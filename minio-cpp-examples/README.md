# Amazon S3 C++ SDK code examples using S3Client for MinIO

## Purpose

This code is a lightly modified version of the [AWS SDK for C++ Code Examples](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/cpp). Specifically, the examples have been modified to work
against MinIO (or any S3-compatible service). 

The included examples are a subset of those in the upstream AWS repository, and focus on the core
operations of PUT, GET, LIST, and DELETE. 

All code herein retains the license and copyright headers from the original repository.
We have added comments to note which files and specific portions of the file have been modified.

## Running the Examples
Before using the code examples, first complete the installation and setup steps of [Getting Started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-cpp/v1/developer-guide/getting-started.html) in the AWS SDK for C++ Developer Guide.
The Getting Started section covers how to obtain and build the SDK, and how to build your own code utilizing the SDK with a sample “Hello World”-style application. 

Next, see [Getting started with the AWS SDK for C++ code examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-cpp/v1/developer-guide/getting-started-code-examples.html) for information on the structure of the code examples, building, and running the examples.

## Additional Information
See [Amazon S3 code examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-cpp/v1/developer-guide/examples-s3.html) in the AWS SDK for C++ Developer Guide for additional information on using the Amazon S3 service with the SDK.
