# MinIO Training Repository

Welcome to the MinIO Training Repository!

This repo contains code examples, slide decks, and other material to support
MinIO training and curriculum initiatives.

These materials are intended for use by MinIO as part of guided trainings. When
referencing these materials independently, please note that example code may not
function as intended due to missing dependencies. We can provide only limited
troubleshooting for these issues.

## Contributions

At this time we are not looking for external contributions to this repository.
These materials are intended for use by MinIO only, and we cannot reasonably
integrate external contributions.

If you have specific suggestions - such as style, or general improvements to a
code snippet that do not change the overall meaning or functionality of an
example, we would be happy to consider these.
