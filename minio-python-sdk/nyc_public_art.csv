The tables, which have been installed in ten community parks across the five boroughs, are a way of giving young teens the chance to voice their opinion and reach out to the public in hopes of inspiring social change through their art. LEAP (Learning through an Expanded Art Program), which has provided public arts&ndash;based education to over two million students K-12 throughout New York City, has empowered its students with this project.

The outdoor project features 100 trees along a four&ndash;and&ndash;a&ndash;half&ndash;mile stretch of the Concourse. Each tree is marked off with a vinyl sign indicating its species and a phone number linked to an audio program featuring stories, sounds, and knowledge of each tree and its surrounding site. 100 audio files correspond to the 100 trees and are each recorded by various locals, poets, artists, and musicians from the Bronx community, while other segments record the sounds of trees, animals, insects, and water. In the words of Katie Holten, the museum is intended to &ldquo;give a voice to the inhabitants, the streets, and neighborhoods from the past, present, and future,&rdquo; which are all interconnected. The Tree Museum is a collaborative project by the Bronx Museum of Arts and Wave Hill, in cooperation with the NYC Department of Parks and Recreation.</span>",X,,,1

Robert Melee,Robert Melee,2008-12-19,2009-06-30,,"<p>The current exhibit by Robert Melee features immense forms that

              upright&ndash;but also retain a haunting sense of disguise and alluring 
              somberness. Melee began creating figurative sculpture in 2005, and 
              these four outdoor bronze sculptures, presented together for the 
              first time, represent some of his most recent work.</p>
            <p>To construct these forms, Melee starts with mannequins to establish 
              the basic human figure, and then works to blur recognizable details 
              with abstract forms by adding built armatures and covering most 
              of the features with canvas and plaster. He then casts the sculptures 
              in bronze and drips and splatters the sculptures with brightly colored 
              enamel paint. The results are works of art that unite formal characteristics

is part of LEAP&rsquo;s Public Art Program. LEAP (Learning through an
Expanded Arts Project) brings teaching artists and experts to
approximately 300 schools per year in the greater New York metropolitan
region. The program uses the arts and hands-on activities to teach the academic curriculum.</p>
         
		<p>As part of the program,
LEAP&rsquo;s instructors challenged the students to explore vital social
issues in their communities and to reflect aspects of those issues,
using common lunchroom tables as their canvas. In this program,
students had the opportunity to meet with and study the works of
esteemed artists, including Christo and Jeanne-Claude, Audrey Flack,
and Tom Otterness. The goal was for students to learn about the
historical power and influence of public art and how to incorporate
this knowledge in their creations.</p> 
        <p>Artworks can be
found at St. James and Crotona parks in the Bronx; Herbert von King
and Maria Hernandez parks in Brooklyn; Marcus Garvey and Sara D.
Roosevelt parks in Manhattan; Marconi and Court Square parks in Queens;
and Silver Lake Park and Stapleton Playground in Staten Island.</p>

Lo! The Fiery Whirlpool,Anna Craycroft,2007-10-17,2008-06-09,,"<p>Anna Craycroft&rsquo;s <em>Lo! The  Fiery Whirlpool </em>is a study in
contrasts. The thick base of the smaller-than-life-size corten steel
lighthouse suggests permanency and a certain ruggedness that seems at
odds with the filigree, almost lacy, cut-out at the apex of the
structure. The form of the work suggests a lighthouse, a structure that
is meant to be impervious to the weather. In contrast to this is the
velvety, rusted texture of the steel, a literal testament to the
structure&rsquo;s vulnerability to water and air.</p>
<p> Craycroft&rsquo;s work was
previously shown at Socrates Sculpture Park as part of the Emerging
Artists show in 2004, at P.S.1/MoMA, and at Governor's Island, among
other locations.</p>",X,,,1
Moore in America: Monumental Sculpture at The New York Botanical Garden,Henry Moore,2008-05-24,2008-11-02,New York Botanical Garden,"<p>This exhibition is the largest outdoor presentation of Henry Moore's
sculpture ever presented in a single venue in the United States. The 20
colossal works are displayed throughout the Garden's 250 acres and
among its 50 gardens and plant collections, providing for an impressive
interaction of nature and art, such as Moore envisioned. Henry Spencer
Moore (July 30, 1898&ndash;August 31, 1986), born in the coal-mining town of
Castleford, Yorkshire, in England, is one of the world&rsquo;s most known and
beloved 20th-century sculptors.</p>
         
        <p>Moore began
studying sculpture as an art student in 1919. Today, his distinctive
bronze works are displayed around the world. His subject matter is
often a reclining woman, a mother and child, or a relationship in
nature. His sculpture makes reference to the landscape and flowing
hills of the countryside. Moore intended that his monumental works be
presented in expansive landscapes where their mass and size could be
seen from many angles, in a great variety of light, and in differing
seasons. He wanted people to get up close and touch them.</p>",X,,,1
The Strategic Placement of Stone,Samuel Nigro,2008-06-26,2009-05-15,,"<p>This sculpture is a 9-ton block of granite that has been split in
two and then recombined. The work encourages visitors to think about
the way massive pieces can come apart and fit back together.
It is the artist's largest stone sculpture to date. Rough, polished,
and beveled surfaces provide a contrast of textures.</p>
         
		<p>Nigro
lives and works in DUMBO, and he hopes to bring to his neighborhood a
""fresh look at an old medium"" while contributing to the vibrant
artistic culture there. His work has been shown in numerous national
and international venues, and he has benefitted from residencies at
Yaddo, MacDowell, and The Vermont Studio Center, and grants from
Artist's Space, The Sculpture Center, and Socrates Sculpture Park.</p>",B,,,1

with the assistance of her yoked bull. Located at Clumber Corner at the
entrance to DUMBO, <em>Large Covered Wagon</em> will be on view
through January 2009. The installation was made possible by the
Walentas Foundation LLC, Two Trees Management Co. and the DUMBO
Improvement District.</p>
         
				<p>Tom Otterness has
exhibited widely and completed commissions in the U.S. and abroad. His
stylized bronze figures combine into sculptural ensembles that explore
the range of human experience, from grand ambition to common foibles,
plucking imagery and themes from popular culture and subtly
transforming them into humorous commentary.</p>",B,,,1
Tree Huts,Tadashi Kawamata,2008-10-02,2009-02-15,,"<p>Tadashi Kawamata creates complex and chaotic architectural growths
of raw lumber, found objects, and construction scraps that bloom around
the park&rsquo;s trees. His artistic practice is finely attuned to the site&rsquo;s
physical characteristics and is organic and improvisational.</p>
         
		<p>Kawamata
has made an international reputation by fashioning humble materials and
found objects such as untreated lumber, chairs, barrels, and
construction scraps into poetic and transformative interventions into
public space. His &ldquo;Project on Roosevelt Island&rdquo; (1992), in which
Kawamata surrounded the island&rsquo;s derelict Smallpox Hospital building
with a massive and complex web of simple wood scaffolding, remains one
of the most well known and highly regarded solo public art works in New
York City&rsquo;s history. Tadashi Kawamata was born in 1953 on the Japanese
island of Hokaido, and he currently lives and works in Japan.</p>

           <p>&ldquo;My
goal is to spark dialogue about a topic often avoided, and often
treated cynically by the contemporary art world,&rdquo; says Mortimer. &ldquo;I
employ the visual language of signage and public information systems,
using them as a contemporary form of older religious communication
systems: stained glass, illuminated manuscripts, church furniture, etc.

Pulse Park,Rafael Lozano-Hemmer,2008-10-24,2008-11-17,,"<p>Rafael Lozano-Hemmer combines seemingly disparate fields of
architecture, digital media, robotics, medical science, and performance
art into enormous temporary landscapes of light and rhythm that double
as platforms for public participation.</p>
         
		<p><em>Pulse Park</em>
is inspired by Roberto Gavaldon&rsquo;s film <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Macario</span> (Mexico, 1960) in which the
protagonist has a hunger-induced hallucination wherein individuals are
represented by lit candles. In <em>Pulse Park</em>, evening visitors
to Madison Square Park will have their systolic and diastolic heart
rates measured by one of two sensor sculptures installed at the North
and South ends of the Oval Lawn. These biometric rhythms are translated
and projected as pulses of narrow-beam light that move sequentially
down rows of spotlights placed along the perimeter of the lawn as each
consecutive participant makes contact with the sensors. The result is a
communal expression of vital signs, transforming the public space into
a fleeting architecture of light and movement.

Society and the NYC Department of Parks &amp; Recreation present a
10-foot high Mao jacket sculpture created by Sui Jianguo (b. 1956,
China), one of the most important contemporary Chinese sculptors
working today. The Mao jacket is part of the series ""Legacy Mantle"" for
which he is best known. The four-ton metal jacket is three meters high, 2.5
meters wide, and 1.5 meters deep.</p> 
          <p>Since the late
1990s, the artist has adopted two motifs for which he is now widely
known: dinosaurs and the Mao jacket. The iconic Mao jacket, emptied of
its signature occupant, appears in monumental fiberglass and in
smaller-sized versions made of aluminum and other materials. At times,
Sui Jianguo combines the two motifs, as in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Sleeping Mao</span>, in which a
fiberglass sculpture of the legendary leader reclines on thousands of

Our Starry Night,James Yamada,2008-04-21,2008-11-12,Doris Freedman Plaza,"<p>Built from powder-coated aluminum and punctuated with 1,900 colored
LED lights, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Our Starry Night</span> is a 12-foot-tall sculpture that acts as
an interactive passageway to Central Park. When visitors walk through
the portal, they trigger a metal detector hidden inside the structure's
casing that activates the LED lights on the exterior of the sculpture.
The sculpture is only illuminated while the participant is standing
within the passageway, and therefore he or she is not able to see the
light patterns being created on the exterior surfaces. Instead, the
lighting is visible to passersby on the street corner and in the park.</p>
           <p>In
this work, Yamada calls our attention to the expanding, yet
increasingly subtle, presence of surveillance in the contemporary
world. It also points towards such philosophical and political
considerations as the loss of privacy in the name of greater safety and
the use of personal information.</p>

Tumbling Mirages,Dennis Oppenheim,2008-06-12,2008-11-09,,"<p><em>Tumbling Mirages</em> consists of three spheres 15 feet in
diameter, made of steel and fiberglass. Oppenheim's new work follows a
long trajectory from his early rejection of the gallery space in favor
of the outdoors and even his own body as sites for art. His first
earthworks in 1967 ""brought the land and the soil into the work
itself."" Oppenheim has shown extensively in major galleries and museums
around the world.

           <p><em>""Tumbling Mirages</em>
are a hybrid sculpture, combining the characteristics of tumbleweed
with the optical illusion emanating from a desert mirage,"" says the

"Plinth, Monument, Stoop",George Sanchez-Calderon,2007-10-01,2007-12-15,,"<p><em>Plinth/Monument/Stoop</em> literally describes the plywood
structure that Sanchez-Calderon built to resemble a plinth for a
classical monument on one side and a stepped entry on the other. He
originally placed the piece in the Overtown, an economically challenged
section of Miami, Florida. For two months, it remained outdoors for
locals to use to their liking &ndash; activities that never resulted in its
destruction. Sanchez-Calderon visited with his camera, asking those at
the scene if they would like to be photographed. Explaining the
plinth&rsquo;s traditional purpose as a pedestal for a work of art instantly
inspired participants to respond. Standing on the plinth, some choose
to present poses in classical contrapposto or defiant gestures of
power. Others lounged on the steps, transforming it into a symbolic
stoop, a traditional social center for many of America&rsquo;s urban centers.</p>
<p>
Locating the work in a New York City park seemed appropriate to the
artist, since parks are traditional locations for the type of
monumental sculpture to which the plinth alludes, while the piece&rsquo;s
&ldquo;stoop&rdquo; side is homage to the entrances of New York City brownstones.</p><p>
Sanchez-Calderon was born in New York City in 1967, the son of Cuban
exiles. His family relocated to Miami, where he now lives and works. He
received his MFA from the Rhode Island School of Design and BFA from
Florida International University. His work is in the permanent
collection of the Miami Art Museum, the Museum of Contemporary Art,
North Miami, the Margulies Collection, the Craig Robbins Collection,

Henry. It consists of a walk-in &ldquo;observation cabinet&rdquo; on the peninsula
in Prospect Park, with copies of excerpts from Henry&rsquo;s diary that are
distributed to viewers for free. Henry&rsquo;s diary tells the story of a man
obsessed with the relationship between wonder and memory. The entries

to Frederic Law Olmsted and his ideas about natural space in cities. In
each cabinet is a song, written by the artist and based on diary
entries. </p>

been installed on Sixth Avenue in New York City, The Indianapolis

Perceval,Sarah Lucas,2007-11-15,2008-04-22,Doris Freedman Plaza,"<p><em>Perceval</em> is a life-sized horse and cart, a replica of the
sort of china ornament that have had pride of place on many British
mantelpieces. Scaled up, the horse is majestic in his power but offers
an unthreatening sense of stolid comfort in his benign reliability. In
the proudly fashioned cart are two concrete cast squashes, outsize and
off-scale, fertility symbols implicating a competitive rural contest to
rival the ritual of the maypole. These giant vegetables are cast in
cement, one of Lucas&rsquo;s favored materials, and take the replication of
the horse and cart knick-knack away from kitsch, the crudeness of this
signature Lucas gesture thrown into sharper relief by the high finish
of the bronze sculpture.</p>
<p>
<em>Perceval</em> reflects a fascination for Englishness evident in
much of Lucas&rsquo;s work. The title is borrowed from the name of one of
King Arthur&rsquo;s <em>Knights of the Round Table.</em> Raised in a forest
by his mother, the virtuous and noble Perceval meets the knights as
they pass and goes off the join them, later becoming involved in the
quest for the Holy Grail. The story has been reworked in various
contemporary versions, notably Eliot&rsquo;s <em>The Wasteland</em> and Wagner&rsquo;s opera <em>Parsifal</em>, in which version the eponymous hero is the one to recover the spear used to pierce Christ during his crucifixion. </p>

the foil of ""the serpent"" or the ""snake"" acting as a representation of
the ""fragility"" and ""fragile future"" of humankind.</p>

Monument,Melora Kuhn,2007-10-03,2008-03-30,,"<p>Kuhn&rsquo;s sculpture for the Cloisters Lawn is a monumental wooden
cut-out in the silhouette of a grand, equestrian memorial statue. The
artist recasts this classic image of the hero into an examination of
what has been left out or forgotten in our histories. It forcibly
reinterprets the idea of the vanquisher. Kuhn chose Fort Tryon Park for
<em>Monument</em> in part because its physical geography&mdash;high on a
hilltop&mdash;enhances the association of the conquering figure. In addition,
the proximity of the Cloisters lends further connection to the history
of Western regimes (including the advent of the American industrialists
who took as their &ldquo;spoils&rdquo; the art and architecture of past European
empires). Finally, the artist adds that the diverse communities of the
surrounding neighborhoods speak to the many cultures whose histories
are often overlooked in the narrative of the subjugating Western men
that still dominates our textbooks.</p>
<p>
Kuhn was born in 1971 in Boston and now lives in Brooklyn and works in
Long Island City. She has a BFA from the Art Institute of Chicago and
has trained in Italy at La Cipressaia, Montagnana, and Scuola Lorenzo
di Medici in Florence. She has had solo exhibitions of her work in New

modifies the work&rsquo;s appearance as the light changes throughout the day. </p>

even set foot on our moon. The inherent desire to move is almost always
the first freedom from which humans are deprived when their kingdoms

Panoramic Echoes,Bill Fontana,2007-03-21,2007-05-01,,"<p><em>Panoramic Echoes </em>is a sound sculpture that is projected
into the north end of the park from speakers located on rooftops of
historic buildings around the park. Layers of environmental sounds
move, float, and echo above the park's predominant sonic background of
traffic noise. The sculpture interacts with the live sounds of the
now-silenced chimes of the Metropolitan Life Tower facing the park,
once the tallest building in the world. The bells at the top of the
tower, which have been silent for more than five years, tolled the
hours for park visitors for over eighty years and will ring again as part
of this sound sculpture. </p>
<p>Bill Fontana has been an innovator in sound art for more than 30 years. Last  summer, Bill&rsquo;s sound sculpture <em>Harmonic Bridge </em>in the Turbine Hall of  the Tate Modern transformed live sounds of the Millennium Bridge into evocative art piece. <em>Speeds  of Time </em>in
2004, also in London, was based on Big Ben&rsquo;s bells. The MetLife Tower
bells play the same melody as Big Ben, the Westminster Chimes, from a
melody from <em>Handel&rsquo;s Messiah</em>. </p>

Twelve feet high, deep and wide, and painted in green and purple

The Fortunate Islands,Seth Weiner,2007-01-01,2007-02-28,Thomas Paine Park,"<p>This installation features a prefabricated security booth, but the
booth does not function as a security node or personnel shelter.
Rather, it contains a tree with small video surveillance monitors

reminiscent of birds in their natural habitat. </p>
                          <p>Canaries
originated from The Canary Islands, which were once referred to as ""The
Fortunate Islands."" For centuries, The Fortunate Islands were thought
to reside at the edge of the world. This, suggests the artist, is not
entirely dissimilar from the way in which many Manhattan residents
regard the lower tip of their island; a neighborhood at the edge of
their world, which also happens to be the world's financial center.
Simultaneously earnest and ironic, the title provides an entry point to
the project's multi-layered metaphors.</p>

Beyond Metamorphosis,Victor Matthews,2004-06-07,2004-06-20,,"Spanning across the park's three-acre lawn, Victor Matthews will construct 
                            a grid of nearly 3,000 umbrellas, each individually 
                            hand-painted with a rendering of a Monarch butterfly. 
                            In his studio, the artist painted the butterfly image 
                            directly onto cotton canvas umbrellas using black, 
                            orange, and yellow water-based colors. Whether viewed 
                            from near or afar, the umbrellas will create a stunning 
                            and vibrant impression of a migrating flutter of 
                            flame-colored butterflies. ""The piece explores 
                            themes of transformation, migration and regeneration,"" 
                            says Matthews. ""Butterflies make an obvious spiritual 
                            gesture that's often overlooked: of a life that never 
                            ends and a spirit that never dies."" The exhibition

Confesiones desde el Vientre (Confessions from the Womb),Lina Puerta,2004-09-24,2004-12-01,,"Located at the intersection of Roosevelt Avenue, 83rd Street and
Baxter Avenue in Queens, Lina Puerta's first foray into the field of
public art pays tribute to the powerful life stories of immigrant women
from Central and South America. <em>Confesiones desde el Veintre</em>,
which translates as ""confessions from the womb,"" originated from
Puerta's interviews with twelve women she met while teaching ceramics
workshops at non-profit community organizations in Jackson Heights,
Queens. Nestled in a busy triangle park adjacent to the elevated 7
train, Puerta's seven teardrop-shaped sculptures will be lifted into
the canopy of trees on 15-foot poles. Sewn from colorful synthetic
fabric, the sculptures cradle small figures within blue plastic mesh.
Each sculpture is further adorned with designs inspired by
pre-Columbian symbols of power and other elements making specific
reference to each woman's story.<br><br><strong>Related Info:</strong> <br><p>

fallen from the sky. At the core of the project is the notion that in a
globalized network, every place is the center of the world; there is no
place that is isolated. That Romo flew to New York from Mexico to
create this public sculpture for Jamaica Flux is evidence of how
closely connected the world is - fitting for an exhibition that is
about connecting people in Jamaica with those who are living in other
parts of New York City and elsewhere. This sculpture and a sound
project by Tracie Morris were exhibited in <a href=""http://nycgovparks.org/sub_about/parks_divisions/historic_houses/hh_king_manor.html"">King Manor</a> in King Park, between 152nd and 153rd Street on Jamaica Avenue, as part of <em>Jamaica Flux: Workspaces &amp; Windows</em>.

Persephone,Noah Baen,2004-11-01,2005-02-02,,"Within yards of the gritty Brooklyn
Queens Expressway, an ecological sculpture by artist Noah Baen reclines
under a hawthorn tree. <em>Persephone </em>was installed on January 11 in Lentol Garden, a bucolic park on Graham Avenue north of Meeker Avenue in Williamsburg. <em>Persephone </em>is
a quilt of leaves clustered within garden netting, its form recalling a
sleeping figure slowly reuniting with the landscape. Named for the
Greek goddess connected with the cycle of seasons, <em>Persephone </em>will
sleep under her tree through the winter, spring, summer and into fall.
As the seasons progress, the natural processes of growth and decay will
gradually break down the leaves. Seeds, gathered with the leaves or
blown in, may sprout, causing plants to grow up through the sculpture.
Eventually, fall will return and another year's withered leaves will
descend upon <em>Persephone</em>.",B,,,1
"Gondwana, for Richard Bellamy",Darrell Petit,2003-07-29,2004-08-31,91st Street,"&#8203;In <em>Gondwana, for Richard Bellamy</em>, Darrell Petit has gently
manipulated Stony Creek Granite and American Oak into a sculpture that
complements the natural landscape of Riverside Park. As the
artist-in-residence at the Stony Creek Granite Quarry in Connecticut,
Petit embraces the geological processes that created the granite and
pushes those processes one step further using heat and splitting
dowels. The title <em>Gondwana</em> refers to an ancient geologic time
when the landmass that is now Connecticut was attached to the African
continent, highlighting the permanence and geologic origins of the
stone. <em>Gondwana</em> is a tribute in stone to Richard Bellamy, the
art dealer who was instrumental in introducing Petit and now-famous
artists such as Mark di Suvero, Donald Judd, and James Rosenquist,
early in their artistic careers.<br><br><strong>Related Info:</strong><br><p>

                            made by George Segal in 1992. The sculpture consists 
                            of seven figures in the act of moving through a fictional 
                            crossroads. The scattered figures seem blind to one 
                            another and to their surroundings. Segal had a particular 
                            ability to elevate mundane day-to-day activities into 
                            a lyrical or elegiac display, depicting his subjects 
                            with their guard down and in a naturalistic stance. 
                            In the early 1960s, he became known for making works 
                            in plaster, which he created by covering his subjects 
                            entirely in dry plaster bandages. He began working 
                            in bronze in the 1970's, and his works in this medium, 
                            including <em>Street Crossing</em>,

                            the importance of water in spiritual myths, theology, 
                            and the rites of many religious traditions. From the 
                            Yoruba of Africa to the ancient Zoroastrians, water 
                            is evoked in sacred practice as a purifying force, 
                            a carrier of messages, and the creator. Nancy Bowen's 
                            ""Water Experiences"" are fountains made of 
                            glazed porcelain and steel. Lesley Dill's contribution, 
                            ""Air Has No Residence;"" consists of floating 
                            text from an Emily Dickinson poem translated into 
                            Hindi. Kelly Kaczynski created a map of Manhattan, 
                            which floats on the water's surface. The exhibition

                            to contemplate scenes of casual social intimacy. The 
                            images, consisting of black silhouetted figures against 
                            a light green background, depict scenes ranging from 
                            the touching to the mundane - a mother kneels to zip

                            a chat, a couple exchanges a kiss. The artist hopes 
                            the signs will spur passersby to be more aware of 
                            the small moments of tenderness that play out all 
                            around us, yet are easily overlooked in the rush and

reference his inspiration, Italian Baroque Sculptor Giovanni Lorenzo
Bernini, and to describe the trajectory that is the extension of the

installation is part of Poast's Color Music series in which he
represents music in physical space. Using the visual qualities of color
and shape as a form of musical notation and the sculpture itself as an
instrument, Poast explains that ""the system is based on the idea that
color sensations can trigger correlations to musical sound in a
performer who is sensitive to visual experience. By combining visual
and aural stimuli, the system and its use can result in an extremely
powerful form of expression.""",M,,,1

colorful organic, biomorphic sculptures to investigate the theme of roots and belonging. 
Dyckman Farmhouse was built by William Dyckman c. 1784 on land gathered by generations 
of Dyckmans, starting with the first family member to arrive in the 1660's. While Smeets 
considers these previous claims of ownership she treats the historic structure as a canvas to 
explore her ideas. Rather than 18th century goods, her sculptures use industrial materials, 
such as Lycra threads, plastic hoses, and concrete spacers.She develops hyperorganic shapes 
that can ooze through barriers, infiltrating and merging with the identity of the historic site. Her 
sculptural creatures challenge viewers to consider how and why they determine something or 
someone belongs. The farmhouse is an ideal setting for these explorations because it is itself 
an unexpected ""creature"" in its urban neighborhood. In her work at the Dyckman Farmhouse 
Tanja uses the concept of fractals, infinitely complex and irregular organic shapes that

On the one hand a tribute to the lush environment, lively atmosphere and fundamentally recreational and replenishing character of public parks, Surveillance is also an acknowledgement and investigation of the proliferating presence of security cameras in public life; an attempt to poetically apply the aesthetic of surveillance in a manner that focuses the eyes and mind on the sensuous visual tableaux and fleeting moments of intimacy that make Madison Square Park such a treasured urban oasis.  Gehr&rsquo;s exhibition is located at the southern end of the Park.

Myrtle Avenue Bird Town,Daniel Goers and Jennifer Wong,2010-05-03,2010-12-10,Person Square and the NW corner of Fort Greene Park,"Goers and Wong will employ recycled materials and experimental building techniques to add flair to the micro-community of birdhouses.  As colorful and as energetic as the birds that inhabit them, this collection of birdhouses will be the stage for an ongoing performance as birds feed, nest, build, and care for offspring. This exhibition will attract and promote the public to observe their native avian neighbors and the ecological relationship between the birds and the urban environment.

 

<br><br>Throughout the duration of the exhibition, Goers and Wong will enact a number of educational workshops, including the South of the Navy Yards Artists stroll in May 2010, in and around the community that will teach children and adults about local bird species and environment awareness. Participants will be encouraged to build their own bird houses with supplies provided by the artists. The installation will also be regularly documented on the exhibition&rsquo;s <a href=""http://www.myrtleavenuebirdtown.com"">website</a>. The artists will provide information and images of the planning, fabrication, and installation, as well as chronicle the lives of the feathered inhabitants of Myrtle Avenue Bird Town.

Viewing Station,Richard Galpin,2010-05-07,2011-05-01,"High Line, between 17th and 18th streets","Richard Galpin alters photographs of cityscapes. His chosen method of manipulation is to cut and remove the top layer of the colored emulsion from his photographic prints, exposing the paper substrate. By eradicating part of the photograph, its imagery becomes transformed to the point of total abstraction. Using clean lines and sharp angles, Galpin&rsquo;s technique emphasizes geometric forms, recalling early 20th century art movements such as Constructivism, Cubism, and Futurism. <br><br>For the High Line, Galpin has created a viewing station that functions similarly to his cut photographs. Park visitors are invited to look through the opening on top of the viewing post, which is lined up with a metal screen from which geometric shapes have been cut. The combination of these two devices abstracts the view of nearby buildings. <br><br>Through relatively simple means, the viewing station distorts optical perspective, making it difficult to judge spatial distance. Its isolation of fragmented areas encourages more acute observation of surface details, and subtleties of color and texture. The view looks more like a two-dimensional image &ndash; such as a photograph or painting &ndash; than three-dimensional space. <br><br>This project is presented by Friends of the High Line.

A View from the Lunch Table: Students Bringing Issues to the Table,LEAP,2010-05-05,2010-09-04,Various Locations,"Students from ten New York City public middle schools, with two schools representing each borough, have transformed school lunchroom tables into personalized canvases and created colorful works of public art that touch upon critical social issues in their community and across the globe. The tables, which have been installed in ten community parks across the five boroughs, are a way of giving young teens the chance to voice their opinions and reach out to the public in hopes of inspiring social change through their art. This exhibition was created by LeAp&rsquo;s Public Art Program in cooperation with NYC Parks and marks the largest student exhibition in the history of NYC Parks and the first to span five boroughs. The program included visits with distinguished artists such as Tom Otterness, Christo, Chuck Close, and Vito Acconci, among many others.

Whitney On Site: New Commissions Downtown,Guyton\Walker,2010-05-08,2010-06-23,820 Washington Street (at the Gansevoort Entrance to the High Line),"&#8203;The Whitney Museum of American Art is pleased to present the first in a series of commissioned works on the site of its future building. These installations will continue through October, allowing artists to respond to the dynamic urban context of the Meatpacking District and heralding plans to bring a downtown Whitney to the neighborhood. Guyton\Walker is a New York&ndash;based collaborative team comprised of Wade Guyton (b. 1972) and Kelley Walker (b. 1969).<br><br>Guyton\Walker&rsquo;s project involves wrapping the site&rsquo;s entire perimeter fence, a span of nearly 450 feet, with sheets of vinyl printed on both sides with brightly colored images of citrus fruits, bananas, and zebras, as well as bold graphic patterns, all of which are woven together digitally to form a kind of twenty-first century mural. A recurring motif of old-fashioned paint cans, recognizable through their metal handles, playfully captures the notion of the Whitney Museum bringing art for the first time to the site of its future facility. Circular holes will be cut at random intervals in the vinyl, providing pedestrians glimpses into the site, where the workings of the Friends of the High Line maintenance and operations team will be visible. Inside the fence, Guyton\Walker will adhere demountable vinyl decals printed with vivid patterns directly to the roofs and sides of some of the High Line maintenance trailers and to the paved area used for parking and plant staging. This festive intervention will activate and visually integrate the site as a whole, introducing playful disjunctions of scale and imagery that will act as a perfect complement to and analogy for one of New York&rsquo;s most vital and changing neighborhoods.<br>&nbsp;<br>For more information please visit the Whitney&rsquo;s <a href=""http://whitney.org/WhitneyOnSite"">website</a>.<br>",M,,,1

Nature's presence in the urban environment can take many forms: green roofs, community gardens, city parks, corporate plazas; Peregrine Falcons nesting on 5th Avenue balconies; vast populations of rats and pigeons that have readily adapted to the habitat of busy streets; Ailanthus trees growing from crumbling buildings, abandoned construction sites, and cracks in the sidewalk. This range from invited and cultivated to invasive and insidious represents everything from the most innovative urban planning and a trend towards the greening of cities, to a symptom of and contributor to the decay of the built environment.<br><br>For more information, visit Socrates Sculpture Park&rsquo;s <a href=""http://www.socratessculpturepark.org/"">website</a>. <br><br><br>",Q,,,1

Manolo Valdes on Broadway,Manolo Valdes,2010-05-20,2011-01-23,"Broadway, Various locations","Manolo Valdes on Broadway includes sixteen bronze sculptures along Broadway from Columbus Circle to 166th Street. Each sculpture will include signage that displays mobile phone access numbers for an English and Spanish language audio tour with informative descriptions of the works.<br><br>Manolo Valdes is one of the most important and respected Spanish artists working today. Best known for his passion for past masters from Zurbaran to Velazquez, Matisse to Lichtenstein, Valdes uses their work ""as a pretext"" (""como pretexto"") to create an entirely new aesthetic object. For example, six massive sculptures entitled Reina Mariana, each over eight feet in height and weighing over two thousand pounds, depict Queen Mariana as immortalized by Velazquez. Four of these sculptures with their abstract and simplified forms will grace the famous city landmark, Columbus Circle, as well as two at the south entrance to the 72nd Street subway station. Also sited at the subway station is Odalisca, 2006, a sculpture whose subtle forms refer to works of Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso. Another highlight of the exhibition is the series of six monumental bronzes &ndash; all over 12 feet in height &ndash; depicting female heads, their calm facial composure and structured equilibrium offset rhythmically by dynamic ornamental head-pieces. The exhibition will also include the New York debut of Valdes' two equestrian sculptures Dama a caballo V, 2008 and Caballero V, 2008, which were inspired by Velazquez's seventeenth-century portraits.<br><br><br>",M,,,1

This second incarnation of <i>Eleven Heavy Things</i> marks its United States debut. <br><br>The cast fiber-glass, steel-lined pieces are designed for interaction: pedestals to stand on, tablets with holes, and free-standing abstract headdresses. A series of three pedestals in ascending height, The Guilty One, The Guiltier One, The Guiltiest One, ask the viewer to ascribe his or her guilt relative to the people around him. A large flat shape, painted with Burberry plaid, hovers on a pole, waiting to become someone&rsquo;s aura. Another hanging shape looks like an intricate lace headdress. A series of tablets invite heads, arms, legs, and one finger. A wider pedestal for two people to hug reads, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know each other, we&rsquo;re just hugging for the picture.&rdquo; July assumes and invites the picture &mdash; 11 photo opportunities, in a city where one is always clutching a camera. Though the work begins as sculpture, it becomes a performance that is only complete when these tourist photos are uploaded onto personal blogs and sent in emails &mdash; at which point the audience changes, and the subject clearly becomes the participants, revealing themselves through the work. <br>",M,,,1

The public participatory event will start at 2 pm and will end when the last box is taken away. <br><br>Through this project, it is the artist&rsquo;s intention to share with the public one small and graceful thing we can do to save the planet, as well as to introduce the traditional Korean philosophy of living in harmony with nature. Bojagi has been used for wrapping and carrying goods in Korea from time immemorial.&nbsp; Traditionally, people believed that the careful wrapping of objects not only showed respect but also brought good fortune and luck. Most importantly, this traditional wrap is not only practical, but also a sustainable and eco-friendly article due to its nearly endless reusability. <br><br>Lee is a recipient of the 2010 Manhattan Community Arts Fund, supported by the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs and administered by Lower Manhattan Cultural Council.

These unusual approaches to painting simultaneously pay homage to and offer a parody of the works of Jackson Pollock, Yves Kline, and other Abstract Expressionist artists.

So I've tried to mark the site with a gathering of words about history, value, and the pleasures and pains of social life. </blockquote><br>In contrast to her most famous works, which combine appropriated images with provocative texts, this installation uses her written statements to respond to the viewer's visual and temporal experience of the site and its surroundings. Some of the statements are drawn from Kruger's catalog of signature phrases like ""YOU BELONG HERE"" and ""BELIEF + DOUBT = SANITY."" Other statements respond to the neighborhood's shifting identity and address the changing industries that have inhabited it from meatpacking to fashion to art.

He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes he had two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his sword-hilt.&rdquo; So begins the best-known children&rsquo;s story by the renowned literary figure, Oscar Wilde (1854&ndash;1900). It seems fitting that British artist Ryan Gander (b. 1976) has taken inspiration for his first public commission from the tale of an enchanted monument. <br><br>Here Gander has re-imagined the final, climactic moments of Wilde&rsquo;s story where the statue is destroyed. Aided by a friendly swallow, the prince has given away all of his jewels and gilding to alleviate the suffering of the city&rsquo;s poor. No longer impressive to city officials, Wilde&rsquo;s denuded metal statue is melted down.<br><br>In Gander&rsquo;s version, the statue appears to be stone; the fallen swallow and the prince&rsquo;s indestructible heart lie amidst the rubble. On closer inspection we see that the &ldquo;ruin&rdquo; is a single massive object: a sculpture of a ruin. In this way, it functions like a plastic toy ruin, at once descriptive and frankly artificial. Gander&rsquo;s wry evocation of Wilde&rsquo;s tale still resonates in our own period of economic inequality. At the same time, it presents a contemporary approach to sculpture, where the role of the public monument remains an open question.<br><br>This is a project by the <a href=""http://www.publicartfund.org/ryangander/"">Public Art Fund</a>. <br>",M,,,1

Created of organic matter, his works have a natural life cycle, changing over time as the sticks settle and decay, eventually returning to the earth they grew from.<br><br>The sculpture at BBG is woven from nonnative woody material that was collected from Ocean Breeze Park on Staten Island. The harvesting site was chosen by BBG's director of Science because of its proximity to the Garden and its large population of nonnative willow which is designated an invasive species in New York State. Removal of saplings of this species helped protect the site's excellent assemblage of herbaceous plants.

From 1968 to 1984 it was the location of Andy Warhol&rsquo;s Factory, where he and his collaborators reinvented the conventional artist&rsquo;s studio, producing silkscreen paintings, films, music, books, magazines, and more. With his Union Square Factory as a creative hub, Warhol became synonymous with the Downtown art scene.<br><br>Inspired by Warhol&rsquo;s art and life, Rob Pruitt (b. 1964, Washington DC) created <i>The Andy Monument</i> as a tribute to the late artist. It stands on the street corner, just as Warhol did when he signed and gave away copies of <i>Interview</i> magazine. Pruitt&rsquo;s sculpture adapts and transforms the familiar tradition of classical statuary. The figure is based on a combination of digital scanning of a live model and hand sculpting, its surface finished in chrome, mounted on a concrete pedestal. It depicts Warhol as a ghostly, silver presence: a potent cultural force as both artist and self-created myth.&nbsp; As Rob Pruitt observes, &ldquo;Like so many other artists and performers and people who don&rsquo;t fit in because they&rsquo;re gay or otherwise different, Andy moved here to become who he was, to fulfill his dreams and make it big.

The images he shot of the space before its conversion into a public park show it as it was for many years: overgrown with wild plants; an untamed meadow-like space cutting through Manhattan's West Side. These images were important catalysts in conveying the potential for the space as a public green space, and helped convert many people into supporters of the movement to save it from demolition. <br><br><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Landscape with Path</span> celebrates the High Line's dual nature as an urban walkway and garden promenade, and brings the work of three celebrated photographers to park visitors on a grand scale.

"Ancient, Goatie Boy, and Goat as Wolf",Ruth McKerrell,2011-06-01,2012-05-30,,"<br>&#8203;McKerrell&rsquo;s three sculptures, originally made of reclaimed Styrofoam, have been cast in aluminum, giving them a timeless presence reminiscent of traditional garden statuary. Two sprightly goats and an alert deer will animate this welcoming space. Attracted to the naivet&eacute; and purity of animals, McKerrell has focused on them in her recent drawings and sculptures.&nbsp; A native of Scotland, she frequented local farms as a child and even owned a pet goat, which inspired <i>Goatie Boy</i>. A regular visitor to the Central Park Children&rsquo;s Zoo, she creates studies from direct observations, as well as historical paintings, and anatomical reference books.&nbsp; However, her final works are made entirely from memory, working intuitively as she imbues her playful subjects with plasticity, life, and undeniable charm.&nbsp; McKerrell is attracted to the &ldquo;freeness and rawness&rdquo; of her modeling materials, which permit her to work spontaneously, and comments that they enable her to &ldquo;create textured surfaces suggestive of an animal&rsquo;s tactile form.&rdquo;<br><br>McKerrell is the recipient of the Clare Weiss Emerging Artist Award. Clare Weiss (1966-2010) was the former Public Art Curator for Parks. During her tenure she curated more than 100 outdoor public art installations throughout the city and organized complex, thought-provoking, and visually compelling thematic exhibitions for the Arsenal Gallery. The Clare Weiss Emerging Artist Award will be granted annually to one emerging artist.

At some sites, computer-generated voices will speak messages of concern, support, and love, intermingled with pragmatic information. In other sites, those same digitized voices will recite poetry and sing love songs to park visitors. <br><br>Installed in 11 different locations throughout the park, the sound will be transmitted through the park's bathroom sinks, water fountains, and elevators. These sites are not only unexpected places in which to encounter public art, they are places designed for individuals or small numbers of people, allowing for intimate encounters within an otherwise sprawling, communal space. The locations for Swartz's sound interventions will be indicated by graphic&mdash;based signage created by the artist that mimics standard public information signs. <br><br>Digital Empathy plays on the notion that, in our culture, we turn to technologies like online social networking, blogs, and instant messages to meet our basic human need for friendship and personal connection. <br><br>This High Line Art Commission is presented by <a href=""http://www.thehighline.org/about/friends-of-the-high-line"">Friends of the High Line</a>.",M,40.74752,-74.00517,1

This retrospective grouping, spanning from 1977 to 2006, brings the outdoor sculpture series, for which he is best known, together for the first time.<br><br>Bryan Hunt&rsquo;s cast bronze and aluminum <i>Waterfalls</i> are the physical outcome of decades-long pursuit to capture water as a found object and sculptural element, frozen and abstracted from nature. His study of water allows him to explore sculptural casting processes as much as natural waterfall compositions. In the 1970s, Hunt became captivated by the sensuality of traditional sculpture by artists like Auguste Rodin, and was inspired to similarly mold and model his works, a deviation from the Minimalist trends of the time. Cast from models in chiseled plaster and wet clay, Hunt&rsquo;s sculptures are made from molten metal which, as it hardens, simulates arrested water.&nbsp;&nbsp; His sculptural cascading forms give, in Hunt&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;liquid a tangible form&rdquo;.<br><br>In 2006 Parks &amp; Recreation unveiled Hunt&rsquo;s permanent outdoor public sculpture entitled <a href=""http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_your_park/monuments/monument_info.php&Alpha;monId=1984"">Coenties Ship</a>, part of Hunt&rsquo;s &ldquo;airships&rdquo; series.

The highly textured surface of the elephant recalls the artist&rsquo;s tactile paintings, in which he creates rich topographic, sculpted surfaces on canvas.<br>&nbsp;<br>Barcel&oacute;, born in Mallorca in 1957, has spent considerable time in West Africa, and his paintings and sculptures often are often concerned with the natural life cycle.<br><br>This is a project by <a href=""http://www.marlboroughgallery.com/"">Marlborough Gallery</a>, in cooperation with the <a href=""http://unionsquarenyc.org/"">Union Square Partnership</a>. <br><br>",M,40.73517,-73.99014,1

Tornado,Michael Sailstorfer,2011-09-20,2012-02-19,Doris Freedman Plaza,"<br>&#8203;This arresting sculpture is the first public commission in the United States by Berlin-based artist Michael Sailstorfer. It is a powerful response to the attributes of the site, for which it was conceived, and to the epic scale of New York City.<br><br>Rising more than 30 feet to meet the treetops of Central Park, <i>Tornado</i> brings together a series of opposite terms. It combines lightness and weight, with looming black &ldquo;clouds&rdquo; made from inflated truck tire inner tubes that gently shift in the breeze. Its muscular steel armature zigzags from top to bottom while the ballooning rubber forms that hang in bunches from its spiraling arms are knotted together in bulging clusters. Like a tornado, which is violently powerful but also literally made of air, Sailstorfer&rsquo;s towering work provides a visceral experience of sculptural form and materials in tension, massive but also vulnerable.<br><br><i>Tornado</i> is the largest in a series of the artist&rsquo;s sculptures that draw on rubber tires, inner tubes, and ideas of movement and velocity. Much of his work engages with natural forces and the way we perceive them through form and physical space.

The sculpture is the culmination of a series begun in 1913 by Lachaise in New York, where he lived and worked from 1912 until his death in 1935. The work represents at once a landscape and the figure of Isabel Dutaud Nagle, the artist&rsquo;s muse, model and eventual wife. Lachaise envisioned a piece that was &ldquo;great and solemn.&rdquo; He later admitted, &ldquo;You may say the model is my wife. It is a large, generous figure of great placidity, great tranquility.&rdquo; Some recognize in Lachaise a revival of the feminine ideal that had flourished for centuries in the voluptuous stone carvings on Hindu temples. Lachaise&rsquo;s wife inspired virtually all of Lachaise&rsquo;s sculptures of the female form. &ldquo;You are the Goddess I seek to express in all my work,&rdquo; he wrote to her in 1915-16. <br><br>This exhibition was made possible by <a href=""http://www.lachaisefoundation.org/"">The Lachaise Foundation</a> and <a href=""http://www.frelinghuysen.org/"">The Frelinghuysen-Morris Foundation</a>.",M,40.76124,-73.96442,1

Peter Woytuk on Broadway,Peter Woytuk,2011-10-21,2012-07-27,Columbus Circle to Mitchel Square,"Peter Woytuk on Broadway brings to the Broadway Malls the vigorous yet endearing sculptures that Woytuk is known for worldwide. This is the artist&rsquo;s first outdoor exhibition in New York City. The exhibition begins in Columbus Circle at 59th Street, the start of the Broadway Malls, with the monumental, life size <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Elephant Pair</span>. A bronze Woytuk menagerie of sheep, ostriches, crows, hens and other fanciful sculptures continues at intervals along the Malls, concluding at Mitchel Square at 168th Street with two 2,500-pound seated <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Bulls</span>.<br><br>Peter Woytuk (American, b. 1958) is recognized internationally for his sculptures of animals. Woytuk cleverly reduces their shapes to essential forms, allowing the power and elegance of his subjects to become both graceful and whimsical expressions of mass. Using a style that is at once descriptive and expressive, Woytuk also enjoys altering the scale of everyday objects such as tools or fruit, which in his hands are transformed into animated participants in the composition.<br><br>Sculptures can be found along Broadway at: 72nd Street, Verdi Square; 73rd Street, Verdi Square; 75th Street; 79th Street; 86th Street; 96th Street; 103rd Street; 107th Street; 114th Street; 117th Street; 137th Street, Montefiore Park; 139th Street; 157th Street; and 168th Street, Mitchel Square.<br><br>The ambitious exhibition is a collaboration by the <a href=""http://www.broadwaymall.org/home/"">Broadway Mall Association</a>, the New York City<br>Department of Parks &amp; Recreation, and the <a href=""http://www.themorrisongallery.com/"">Morrison Gallery</a> of Kent, CT.<br>",M,40.76809,-73.98189,1

As park visitors enter the structure, they encounter a 14-sided featureless chamber inspired by The Beatles&rsquo; Abbey Road recording studio and the test site for the Goldsmiths experiments.&nbsp; The space between the interior and exterior walls will be filled with lights emanating a soft glow, and speaker cabinets emitting low-frequency audio tones outside the range of human hearing.</p><p>&ldquo;In my last several years of work I have become interested in the psychological/optical response of the human body to physiological 'prompts' &ndash; things like Brion Gysin&rsquo;s &lsquo;Dream Machine,&rsquo; or the way hypnosis can produce visions.&nbsp; I also find it fascinating the way that specific architecture can prompt memory, or nostalgia, remind one of lost time or time passing.&rdquo;</p><p>This is a project by the <a href=""http://www.thehighline.org/"">Friends of the High Line</a>.</p>",M,40.74228,-74.00775,1
Well,Leonard Ursachi,2011-10-29,2012-08-25,,"<p>Leonard Ursachi&rsquo;s sculpture, with its wellhead, lever and bucket, is suggestive of a traditional rural well. &ldquo;The well is a shared resource and gathering place. Its iconography is mythic&mdash;the source from which life and knowledge spring; a receptacle for our dreams and desires. I&rsquo;m interested in the significance of the well today,&rdquo; states Ursachi.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are still communities that depend on wells, the health of which is affected by conditions that originate both locally and across the globe&mdash;pollution, industrial waste, climate change, wars.&rdquo;</p><p>For the wellhead, Ursachi cast blocks in transparent, water-blue acrylic with embedded crushed, empty plastic water bottles. He created the mold for the blocks from an antique cobblestone salvaged from a Brooklyn street when it was being torn up. The bottom surface of the wellhead is mirrored and like a traditional well, viewers will see their own reflections when they peer into the opening. Ursachi made the wellhead&rsquo;s base, bucket, and lever from wood he salvaged from the East River, a block from his DUMBO studio.</p>",B,40.6998,-73.99009,1

Inveterate Composition for Clare,Rachel Owens,2011-11-13,2012-06-15,1st Avenue and 47th Street,"Placed in Manhattan&rsquo;s Dag Hammarskj&ouml;ld Plaza, the historic &ldquo;Gateway to the UN&rdquo; and designated protest site, this piece is composed of dissembled parts from two replica ""kit"" military Hummer shells, recomposed and welded together in a monumental pyramid-shaped stack. Sprayed with metallic icy-white paint, the piece also evokes the form of an iceberg. Additional parts welded between the two create a more cohesive form and refer to extra armaments that American soldiers have recently added to their own Hummers and equipment.<p></p><p>The moody songs of whales will emanate from the speakers &ndash; the haunting sounds act as a universal cry. In accordance with this soundtrack, the headlights of the cars will be set to dim and brighten.</p><p>With its rearranged parts, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Inveterate Composition</span> also places itself in recent art history dialogue. The crashed car has become an iconic form of the violence and excesses of contemporary culture as seen in work from John Chamberlain's car part sculptures and Andy Warhol&rsquo;s infamous <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Death and Disaster</span> series, to Charles Ray&rsquo;s <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Untitled</span> sculpture and Jeremy Deller&rsquo;s <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Conversations about Iraq</span>. Summoning references from the political strife and conflict overseas to our planet&rsquo;s general discord, Rachel Owens&rsquo;s latest sculpture continues this discourse, while adding focus on environmental distress to the pile of ruins. However, her abstract, melodious form also has a hulking beauty and calming presence that speaks to an undertone of optimism and the potential for change and renewal.</p><p>This work was originally developed with the enthusiastic support of the late <a href=""http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_things_to_do/attractions/public_art/clare_weiss_emerging_artist_award.html"">Clare Weiss</a>, curator for the New York City Parks Department, who passed away in January 2010 after a long battle with breast cancer.

Art celebrates the artist&rsquo;s first public art commission in New York City, which features both new, site-specific and existing works displayed throughout the Park. Olivier&rsquo;s series of stop-motion animations brightens New York&rsquo;s winter landscape with moving images exemplary of the artist&rsquo;s characteristically rich color palette and lavishly textured style. The exhibition is on view daily in Madison Square Park from December 15, 2011 through March 12, 2012.<br><br>Beginning with a single image, Olivier introduces subtle alterations with each additional layer through his process of over-painting.&nbsp; After he paints and re-paints his images, Olivier photographs each stage of the process as stop-motion animation until an original no longer exists. The resulting work reveals a history of the painting process that captures scraps of narrative and visual iconography brought to light as a moving painting.<br><br>According to the artist, Jacco Olivier, exhibiting in Madison Square Park provides &ldquo;an opportunity to go totally abstract and see things on a molecular level, to change perspective[&hellip;] to show an animation in the ground, you really have to look down to see it, which creates a little private moment for the viewer that is free of narrative, subject or meaning.&rdquo;<br><br>This is a project of <a href=""http://www.madisonsquarepark.org/"">Mad.Sq.Art</a>. <br><br>",M,40.74222,-73.98798,1

Passing Glances,Peter Bulow,2012-03-05,2012-08-31,Stan Michels Promenade,"Sculptor Peter Bulow is displaying a dozen of his subway portraits to Fort Tryon Park&rsquo;s open-air gallery in upper Manhattan. Hand-picked from the close to 400 miniature clay sculptures Bulow has created on the New York City subway system over the past four years, these 12 life-sized heads were fired in terra cotta exclusively for the exhibition. <br><br>In a sense, Bulow&rsquo;s subway portraits began developing decades ago, &ldquo;I grew up in Berlin and every weekend my grandmother took me to the zoo where I&rsquo;d model the lions and tigers in clay. By doing this, I felt like they became part of me.&rdquo; Bulow&rsquo;s family immigrated to the United States when he was eight. Bulow muses, &ldquo;As an adult, I was drawn to psychiatry, perhaps by the desire to know people from the inside out, to learn who they really are. A few years ago, I began to make sculptures of fellow passengers on the subway--I wanted to capture all of those passing faces. That old feeling from my childhood, of being able to connect to a living energy through clay, came back to me.&rdquo;<br><br>Bulow views his subway portraits as a cross-section of America, that strange and wonderful land his parents took him to and he became part of. He explains, &ldquo;I see my subway sculptures as Roman portraits of the 21st century, a time capsule capturing the personalities of our time. Most were created on the A line, between 59th Street and 168th Street. Sometimes I have an entire train ride to do a portrait, and sometimes my model gets off at the next stop.&rdquo; <br>",M,40.86002,-73.93392,1

Untitled (Good & Bad),Uri Aran,2012-04-19,2013-04-14,Between West 25th and West 26th Streets,"<p>For the High Line, Uri Aran presents a sound work that explores how we use personification and animal metaphors to define human behavior in our daily conversations. Working with a professional voice actor who uses a formal, slightly affected pronunciation, Aran has created a sound track that will emanate softly from the planting beds below the elevated pathway on the High Line between West 25th and West 26th Streets. The sound track features the actor reading a list of creatures, from common ones, like the household cat and the spider, to more wild ones, such the platypus and the shark, each described as &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad.&rdquo; Serious and at times comical, the expressionless tone of the actor&rsquo;s voice will clash with the definition of these creatures as either &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad,&rdquo; sparking dialogue about the arbitrary nature of classification in language. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Uri Aran&rsquo;s imaginative works have always amazed me,&rdquo; said Cecilia Alemani, the Donald R.

Walking Figures,Magdalena Abakanowicz,2012-04-17,2012-09-07,,"<p>Abakanowicz is recognized as one of the most potent and unique voices in contemporary art with a distinct sculptural vocabulary that expresses a philosophical quest. The sculptures exhibited at Dag Dag Hammarskjold Plaza are titled <em>Walking Figures</em>, 2009. This group of ten headless, armless bronze figures, each approximately 8 1/2 feet tall, stands facing in one direction, with one foot forward, giving the impression of an advancing and forbidding army. The figures are all unique, as the intricately rippled surfaces differ on each, imparting individuality. Viewed from behind, the skin-like texture gives way to a smooth, concave surface, reminiscent of an empty husk. Dag Hammarskjold&rsquo;s notable quote, &ldquo;Never look down to test the ground before taking your next step; only he who keeps his eye fixed on the far horizon will find the right road&rdquo; seems a perfect conceptual foundation for the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Walking Figures</span> which are at once beautiful and unsettling, a reminder of the fragile nature of the human condition.

 is curated by Amy Smith-Stewart. The artists were asked to proffer 
alternative visions and an imaginative future for the northern 
industrial stretch of Long Island City, Queens that encompasses both 
organizations - Socrates and Noguchi. In 2011, each artist formed a team
 (listed below) comprised of architects, urban planners, writers, 
historians, and other consultants to re-imagine the area in response to 
increasing residential development, rezoning, and ecological threats. 
Their findings were exhibited as models, installations and drawings at 
The Noguchi Museum from October 13, 2011 to April 22, 2012. Now at 
Socrates, their ideas, which address accessibility, sustainability, 
community building, and urban environment, will be realized through 
sculpture, site-specific installations, earthworks and participatory, 
social activities.</p>

	Originally debuted in painted resin at the 2007 Venice Biennale, <em>Survival of Serena</em> was named in honor of Venice&rsquo;s former name <em>La Serenissima</em>, which literally means &#39;the most/very serene&rsquo;, a theme which transverses much of Feuerman&#39;s body of work. The sculpture went on to win first prize in the Beijing Biennale the following year.&nbsp;The artist has Petrosino Square to unveil her new bronze <em>Survival of Serena</em> for the first time given its proximity to many cultural institutions and diverse neighborhoods.&nbsp;</p>",M,40.72213,-73.99718,1
Lying Figure,Thomas Houseago,2012-05-18,2013-03-14,At Little West 12th Street,"Known for using materials like wood, clay, plaster, steel, and bronze, Houseago creates monumental sculptures that reveal the process of their making through unique details &ndash; the varying texture of a molding, the hidden creases within a cast &ndash; despite their imposing size and towering forms. His sculptures also incorporate drawing in the form of sketches on plaster and wood panels. Houseago&rsquo;s work explores abstract lines and figurative forms, and in doing so he joins a long tradition of sculptors that spans from Giacometti to Picasso, engaging viewers with qualities that are at once impressive and enchanting.
<p>
	For the High Line, Houseago presents <em>Lying Figure</em>, a 15-foot-long bronze sculpture of a headless giant resting on its elbows on the wooden rail ties between the High Line&rsquo;s original rail tracks. As the third project in the HIGH LINE COMMISSIONS series for spring, 2012, Houseago&rsquo;s Lying Figure will juxtapose <a href=""http://thehighline.org/about/public-art/lilliput"">Lilliput</a>, the group exhibition that debuted on Thursday, April 19. <em>Lilliput</em> takes its title from Jonathan Swift&rsquo;s Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels, and conjures a magical world populated by fairy tale creatures, mysterious idols, and dreamlike landscapes. Houseago&rsquo;s <em>Lying Figure </em>will introduce the presence of a giant &ndash; the park&rsquo;s own Gulliver &ndash; into Lilliput&rsquo;s diminutive sculptures installed along the park&rsquo;s pathway and amidst the plants.</p>

First Street Iron,Robert Sestok,2012-04-20,2013-04-20,,"Robert Sestok spent most of his career living and working in downtown Detroit, Michigan, which greatly influenced his artistic methods. As part of Detroit&rsquo;s Cass Corridor arts community, a vibrant movement of artists, musicians, poets and writers during the 60s and 70s, Sestok frequently used found objects and other non-traditional materials, tearing things apart and reconstructing them. This deconstructivist process reflected the reality of the city at the time, and can still be seen today.&nbsp; Though hailing from the Motor City, Sestok frequented New York throughout his life and stated that <em>First Street Iron</em> is &ldquo;a tribute to my past associations with the city of New York.&rdquo;
<p>
	This ten-foot-tall, welded steel sculpture will be placed in the formerly inaccessible property at 33 First Street acquired by New York City&rsquo;s Parks &amp; Recreation the in 1935. Since 2008, First Street Green (FSG) has worked with Parks Department to revitalize the fallow lot adjacent to First Park&mdash;with the goal to remove the rubble and create a plaza and cultural space. The lot was fully renovated with a newly stabilized and paved plaza, landscaping and cast-iron fencing in 2011 when the park hosted the BMW Guggenheim Lab, a three-month temporary pavilion and public forum in which a varied range of cultural activities occurred.&nbsp; During this period 55,000 visitors attended&mdash;reinforcing First Street Green&rsquo;s original observation of a strong need and broad interest in an ongoing cultural space open for public use.</p>

Pet Sounds,Charles Long,2012-05-02,2012-09-09,,"<p>
	Pet Sounds is an interactive, large-scale, mixed-media installation by acclaimed California-based artist Charles Long. Sited on Madison Square Park&rsquo;s expansive Oval Lawn, <em>Pet Sounds</em> introduces a snaking network of vibrantly colored pipe railings creating new paths as they wind across the urban oasis. As these railings converge around a common seating area, each railing begins to grow into a unique fantastic form. While the shape of each blob suggests a different set of associations, their uncanny semblances remain wonderfully elusive. As viewers smooth their hands over the undulating biomorphic surfaces, the act of touching produces a variety of sounds and vibrations coming from within the sculptural&nbsp;forms.</p>

Common Ground,Various Artists,2012-05-23,2012-11-30,,"<p>
	From the monuments of ancient Egypt to the Statue of Liberty, public art has been a means to represent a society&rsquo;s beliefs, values, and ideals. However, in our own diverse and pluralistic culture, we tend to value art most highly as the expression of a unique individual vision. <em>Common Ground</em> brings together the work of ten international contemporary artists, each with a strikingly original artistic language <em>and</em> a strong engagement with its civic context and traditions.</p>
<p>
	Several works in the exhibition create a dialogue with the history of art, finding contemporary metaphors in classical forms. Over time, such forms have lost much of their original authority, yet they continue to resonate for artists today. The civic monument, long dominated by representations of the heroic male, is reinvented through the use of abstraction, irony, and satire. The democratic notion of public space as a forum for ideas is explored through text, objects, and performance. The role of the artist becomes a theme in works that imply both the transience of life and the timelessness of art. Together, these very different works remind us that contemporary art offers us both opportunities for personal reflection and shared moments of collective expression.</p>

	Artists include:&nbsp; <strong>Michael Elmgreen and Ingar Dragset; Ian Hamilton Finlay, Roger Hiorns, Jenny Holzer, Matthew Day Jackson, Christian Jankowski, Justin Matherly, Paul McCarthy, Amalia Pica, and Thomas Schutte.</strong></p>

<p>
	The artists were inspired by Japanese artist and printmaker Katsushika Hokusai&rsquo;s celebrated woodblock print <em>Under the Wave off Kanagawa</em> (1830&ndash;32). &nbsp;Constructed out of recycled scaffolding materials, the crest rises above the viewer spraying forth water droplets, similar to the troubled sea in Hokusai&rsquo;s composition. This turquoise, tubular sculpture represents the vascular system of a wave and offers a refreshing mist from each of the five crests. &nbsp;Padilla-Harris&rsquo; playful use of line and form transitions a static sculpture into a vehicle of poetic expression that contrasts the fragility of human life with the power of nature.</p>",R,40.56003,-74.10169,1
A View from the Lunch Table: Students Bringing Issues to the Table,LeAp,2012-06-08,2012-08-31,Citywide,"<p>
	Students from ten New York City public middle schools, with two schools representing each borough, have transformed school lunchroom tables into personalized canvases and created colorful works of public art that touch upon critical social issues in their community and across the globe. The tables, which have been installed in ten community parks across the five boroughs, are a way of giving young teens the chance to voice their opinions and reach out to the public in hopes of inspiring social change through their art. This exhibition was created by LeAp&rsquo;s Public Art Program in cooperation with NYC Parks and marks the largest student exhibition in the history of NYC Parks and the first to span five boroughs. The program included visits with distinguished artists such as Emma Amos, Mark di Suvero, Audrey Flack, Christo, Mel Kendrick, and Sanford Biggers, among many others. For 33 years, LeAp (Learning through an Expanded Art Program) has provided arts&ndash;based education to over two million students K-12 throughout New York City.</p>
<p>
	Artworks can be found through August at: Central Park and Augustus Saint-Gaudens Playground in Manhattan; Kaiser Park and Detective Joseph Mayrose Park in Brooklyn; Crotona Park and Claremont Park in the Bronx; Juniper Valley Park and Forest Park in Queens; and Silver Lake Park and Snug Harbor Cultural Center in Staten Island.</p>

Samsara,Ujin Lee,2012-06-19,2012-06-19,,"&acirc;&euro;&lsaquo;<em>Samsara, </em>continues a theme that Lee has been exploring in the past several years, mixing performance and public participation with installation in her large-scale site-specific projects. She regards her performances as an extension of her installations into time and space and views herself an intermediary of a flowing continuum.
<p>
	In <em>Samsara, </em>Lee will create a performance at the Arch plaza with a structured grouped installation in a linear configuration that consists of over 300 cylindrical sculptures made of ramie cloths and thread. Viewers will then be invited to take a piece of the work home, contributing to the slow disappearance of the installation throughout the day.</p>
<p>
	The performance and installation viewing will take place from noon to 4:00 p.m., followed by the public participation session.</p>
<p>
	This interdisciplinary project is rooted in the artist&rsquo;s investigation and study of expanding the ways in which everything in this world is connected in a perpetual circle of continuous flow. <em>Samsara </em>is the cycle of birth, life, death, rebirth, or reincarnation within Hinduism, Buddhism, and most other Indian&nbsp; eligions. Lee interprets this concept through her work in modern parlance using objects, places, people, and possessions, but stays true to the original meaning of the word which referred to a process of continuous pursuit or flow of life.</p>

	Sharing a natural dialogue with Union Square at the vibrant nexus of New York City is Malcolm D. MacDougall&rsquo;s sculpture, <em>Microscopic Landscape</em>. The 24 foot, 7,500 lb work &ldquo;is about potential energy and pushing a stagnant object as close to perceived movement as possible.&rdquo; The constant motion found in Union Square is a microcosm teeming with diversity that defines the city, finding its inspiration in the multifaceted structures of the sculpture, and in turn inspiring this artist to observe activities as seen on the molecular level. The sculpture serves as a snapshot of the ongoing activity in the neighborhood; it is a static object that maintains the constant anticipation of movement, just as the grounds of Union Square provide the framework for the energetic flow of people and commerce.

The large-scale pieces are currently on view on the Grand Concourse between 161st&nbsp;and 164th&nbsp;Streets in the Bronx. &ldquo;The placement of the weavings defines the inner triangular shape at the heart of Joyce Kilmer Park and creates a place where people can enter into a spatial drawing.&rdquo; The brick and mosaic Art Deco patterns that have historically defined the neighborhood&rsquo;s architectural landmarks are interpreted through Daniel&rsquo;s interlaced geometric forms, horizontal stripes, and vertical bands that grace the park&rsquo;s permanent wire fencing. Transcendent of an ordinary walk through the park, a stroll through <em>Ornamental Paths</em> will be a new experience full of color and history.</p>

FlockHouse,Mary Mattingly,2012-06-16,2012-08-15,Citywide,"&acirc;&euro;&lsaquo;The Flock House initiative examines questions of mobile, self-sufficient living units becoming building blocks for future cities. &nbsp;Reflecting the future of urban space and building upon existing structures, Flock House comprises a group of mi&Acirc;&Acirc;&Acirc;­gratory, public, sculptural habitats that imagine a world where created envi&Acirc;&Acirc;&Acirc;­ronments are adaptable, collapsible, portable, and modular. As expanding urban populations face environmental, social, and economic change, Flock Houses can be built in, transported to, and survive in and among urban cen&Acirc;&Acirc;&Acirc;­ters along three planes of living (sub&Acirc;&Acirc;&Acirc;­terranean, ground, and sky).
<p>
	The form and function of Flock House is inspired by current patterns of global human migration, immigration, and pilgrimage. Through workshops, organized events, an interactive website, and narrated cell phone tours, the Flock House project catalyzes and enhances community-interdependence, resourcefulness, learning, curiosity, and creative exploration.</p>
<p>
	Mobile Flock House living systems are interstitial, autonomous, and dependent on local community relationships to maintain, share, and operate. As living systems, they function as bridges for cross-discipline, cross-boundary, and cross-border notions of property and polity.</p>
<p>
	Built collaboratively upon re&Acirc;&Acirc;&Acirc;­claimed, recycled, redesigned, and rethought materials, Flock House promotes wider adoption of natural systems including rainwater capture, inner-city agriculture, and solar and human-powered energy technologies.</p>

How I Roll,Paola Pivi,2012-06-20,2012-07-18,Doris C. Freedman Plaza,"<p>
	According to a famous anecdote, three pioneers of modern art&Acirc;&Acirc;­&ndash;Constantin Brancusi, Marcel Duchamp, and Fernand L&eacute;ger&ndash;are said to have visited the 1912 Paris Air Show. Observing a propeller, Brancusi said, ""Now that is what I call sculpture!"" A hundred years later, Paola Pivi&rsquo;s <em>How I Roll</em> suggests that the modernist romance with industrial design lives on. Pivi&rsquo;s sculpture incorporates an entire six-seat plane that has been specially modified, enabling it to rotate through 360 degrees while held aloft on its wing tips. The artist&rsquo;s transformation allows this 1977 Piper Seneca to be seen in an entirely new way. Airborne but flightless, its steady circular movement is mesmerizing. The shift of context from airport hangar to New York City plaza is equally dramatic. It creates the striking and surreal experience of a familiar object seen in an unexpected place doing a very unfamiliar thing. Like a child&rsquo;s dream come to life, <em>How I Roll</em> is typical of the artist&rsquo;s bold and playful imagination.

The project is composed of a series of frames of slender wood posts, defining a space of 20 feet wide on each side with a roof canopy.

In this combined piece, abstractions of light travel across and into space created by Cage. Shot entirely in black and white, a camera pans across the blank wall of a Munich television studio, illuminated by soft cloud-like patches of light which drift across the view of the camera. To describe <em>One<sup>11</sup></em> Cage wrote, &ldquo;<em>One<sup>11</sup></em> is a film without subject. There is light but no persons, no things, no ideas about repetition and variation. It is meaningless activity which is nonetheless communicative, like light itself, escaping our attention as communication because it has no content to restrict its transforming and informing power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Of the sound composition <em>103</em>, Cage wrote, &ldquo;<em>10</em> is an orchestral work. It is divided into seventeen parts. The lengths of the seventeen parts are the same for all the strings and the percussion. The woodwinds and the brass follow another plan. Following chance operations, the number of wind instruments changes for each of the seventeen parts."" On the High Line, Cage's arrangement in light, darkness, and probability will illuminate the High Line&rsquo;s passageway at West 14th Street and initiate a series of chance encounters with visitors to the park.</p>

"Women (065, 055)",Elad Lassry,2012-08-01,2012-09-07,Billboard next to the High Line at West 18th Street and 10th Avenue,"<p>
	Los Angeles-based artist Elad Lassry presents a new commission for the 25-by-75 foot billboard next to the High Line.</p>
<p>
	Over the course of his career, Elad Lassry has investigated the history and power of images through different mediums, such as photography, film, sculpture, and performance. His small-scale photographs, usually presented in frames that take their color from the main hue of the photograph, are still lifes of mundane objects or portraits depicting individuals and animals from vintage magazines, film archives, or original images shot at Lassry&rsquo;s studio. Lassry&rsquo;s photographs are highly staged, intense in their vivid colors, and, at times, puzzling in their visual openness. Removed from their visual context, they question the tradition of photography while investigating &ndash; at times ironically &ndash; the power of the image and our contemporary engagement with them.</p>
<p>
	Invited by High Line Art to present on HIGH LINE BILLBOARD, Lassry has created an alluring new image of two young women, both dressed alike, gazing out of two small portholes into a sea of green. Detached from any visual history or context, the image is both mesmerizing and elusive, familiar and remote. It allows the viewers to create their own conceptual space and visual context for the image.</p>

EAF12: 2012 Emerging Artist Fellowship Exhibition,Various Artists,2012-09-09,2013-03-31,,"&#8203;Each year, Socrates Sculpture Park selects artists to produce outdoor artworks within the Park. Reflective of our time, these artists are making public sculptures that are subtly mysterious, visually compelling, and, at times, provocative. The economy, spirituality, Americana, language, and our built/natural world are subjects explored in this presentation of emerging artists to watch. Rather than being a zeitgeist or thematic exhibition, each artist has a distinct artwork (and in some cases performance) that embodies his or her individuality, passion, and exploration of art in the public sphere. A 1965 Ford Mustang painted white with corn-rowed racing stripes, slabs of cast concrete snapped from compression, a transparent floating Buddha, and a stunning 30 foot flag pole woven with security straps are among the sculptures in the exhibition.<br />
<br />
Unique to anywhere in New York City, artists are awarded a grant and a residency in the Park&#39;s outdoor studio and receive technical support to facilitate the production of new outdoor sculptures for exhibition in the Park. The artists develop their projects throughout the summer in the open studio and on-site in the landscape, offering visitors the opportunity to experience the creation of the works that are then installed in the Park. The sculptural works in this exhibition are presented in a heavily used public space in an ethnically diverse community and situated within a beautiful waterfront area of Queens with views of the Manhattan skyline.<br />
<br />
The 2012 Emerging Artists are: <strong>Jarrod Beck, Melissa Calderon, Cui Fei, Brent Everett Dickinson, Sarah Dornner, Tamar Ettun, Jessica Feldman, Ben Hall, Charles Harlan, Hugh Hayden, Chang-Jin Lee, Fernando Mastrangelo, Bundith Phunsombatlert, Jeff Williams,</strong> and <strong>Seldon Yuan</strong>.",Q,40.76832,-73.9366,1
Untitled (Stump Fire #4),Catherine Opie,2012-09-09,2013-03-31,,"&#8203;<em>Untitled (Stump Fire #4)</em>, an 11' x 28' photograph by artist Catherine Opie, is the newest installment of Socrates Sculpture Park's ongoing Broadway Billboard series.<br><p>
	Opie has created a mise-en-sc&Alpha;ne of epic scope, drama, and mystery. Nature and artifice, light and darkness are just some of the contradictory elements of Opie's image that create an ominous tableau for us to contemplate. Neither a warm hearth, nor regenerative forest fire, we discover it is liquid, not wood, which is ablaze. The log stumps in the foreground are Opie's own handmade clay sculptures, which further heightens the surrealism of the scene. The image hovers between an apocalyptic figment of our imaginings and the possibility of nature run amok. What is clear, however, is that all is not well within our environment or psyche. <em>Untitled (Stump Fire #4)</em> is from a series of new work and will be part of an exhibition at Regen Projects, Los Angeles in 2013.<br>
	<br>
	Catherine Opie is one the great photographers of this generation and documentarian of our American landscape and people. A graduate of CalArts, she currently teaches in the studio program at the University of California at Los Angeles. Select solo exhibitions include Catherine Opie: Figure and Landscape at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (2010), Catherine Opie: American Photographer at the Guggenheim Museum in New York (2008), Catherine Opie: Chicago at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago (2006). Opie was a 2009 recipient of the President's Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Women's Caucus for Art and was awarded a United States Artists Fellowship in 2006.</p>

Tomorrow,Akihiro Ito,2012-09-27,2013-08-30,Northeast Corner at Myrtle Avenue and Washington Park,"<p>
	The Myrtle Avenue Brooklyn Partnership presents<em> Tomorrow</em>, a temporary installation by Akihiro Ito. From September 27, 2012 through August 2013, the piece will be installed at the northeast corner of Fort Greene Park (Myrtle and Washington Park).</p>
<p>
	Akihiro Ito&rsquo;s sculpture, <em>Tomorrow</em>, illustrates the harmony between humans and their natural surroundings, and reminds us of the importance of preserving our environment. Tomorrow is made of 600 pieces of laminated dimensional wood (Douglas fir) which form the shape of a baby &ndash; a symbol of future generations. He used this material to draw the connection between people and nature. Wood is environmentally friendly as it emits no pollutants, is a familiar resource that has been utilized for millennia, and instills feelings of warmth, serenity, and relief in people. Mr. Ito says, &ldquo;Nowadays, we are facing serious environmental problems such as global warming, waste and resource depletion. We have to preserve nature and save our earth for our future generations and for all living beings. I hope this sculpture provides an opportunity for people to think about humanity&rsquo;s connection to nature, and reminds us that we are all part of earth&rsquo;s family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Bringing sculpture to Myrtle Avenue is part of the Partnership&rsquo;s larger public art initiative to underscore the neighborhood&rsquo;s creative spirit and highlight our public spaces with art,&rdquo; says Meredith Phillips Almeida, the Partnership&rsquo;s Deputy Director. Throughout the duration of the installation, an informational card about the artist and work, designed by the Partnership, will be available at the site. The Partnership will also develop a site visit guide for local schools.</p>

Standing over ten feet tall, the facial features of &ldquo;The King&rdquo; correspond to what was considered beautiful at the time: a slight strabismus, deformed cranium, and ear covers.

Art presents a monumental sculpture by acclaimed artist, <strong><a href=""http://villareal.net/"">Leo Villareal</a></strong>. Largely inspired by the work of Buckminster Fuller, Villareal&rsquo;s <em>BUCKYBALL</em> will apply concepts of geometry and mathematical relationships within a towering 30-foot tall, illuminated sculpture.</p><p>A commission of the Mad. Sq. Art program, Villareal&rsquo;s <em>BUCKYBALL </em>will feature two nested, geodesic sculptural spheres comprised of 180 LED tubes arranged in a series of pentagons and hexagons, known as a &ldquo;Fullerene,&rdquo; referring to the form&rsquo;s discovery by Buckminster Fuller. Individual pixels located every 1.2 inches along the tubes are each capable of displaying 16 million distinct colors and will be specifically tuned by the artist&rsquo;s own software, creating a subtle and sophisticated palette to enliven the Park. Relying on LED technologies driven by chance, <em>BUCKYBALL</em>&rsquo;s light sequences will create exuberant, random compositions of varied speed, color, opacity, and scale. <em>BUCKYBALL</em> will trigger neurological processes within the brain, calling on our natural impulse to identify patterns and gather meaning from our external environment.
<p>
	Through basic elements such as pixels and binary codes, Villareal allows for a better understanding of the underlying structures and systems that govern everyday function. As he builds these simple elements into a full-scale sculptural installation that moves, changes, and interacts, this work ultimately grows into a complex, dynamic form that questions common notions of space, time, and sensorial pleasure.</p>

The Glass Sea,Jessica Feldman and Steven Gertner,2012-10-25,2012-11-25,,"<p>
	Addressing issues of empathy, urban solitude, expulsion, and confinement, <em>The Glass Sea</em> depicts the daily lives and living spaces of inmates and patients in hospitals, jails, and psychiatric centers surrounding New York City. Drawing correlations among, Randall&rsquo;s, Riker&rsquo;s, Wards, Governors, and Roosevelt Islands, Feldman examines a population isolated physically and metaphorically by the boundaries imposed upon them as members of&nbsp; &ldquo;disobedient&rdquo; or &ldquo;dysfunctional&rdquo; groups.</p>
<p>
	Projected on designer Steven Gertner&rsquo;s striking, architecturally warped reinterpretation of a jail cell and rooms from these island establishments, <em>The Glass Sea</em> was created through a painstaking process of visiting and interviewing current and past residents of these nearby institutions. Through personal reenactment of inhabitants&rsquo; daily routines, Feldman creates a paradoxical experience of empathetic documentation, allowing viewers to imagine life from the perspective of the isolated.

Fir Tree,Monika Sosnowska,2012-10-24,2013-02-17,Doris C. Freedman Plaza,"<p>
	This 40-foot-tall steel sculpture by Monika Sosnowska marks the threshold between the urban environment of midtown Manhattan and the landscape of Central Park. The artist has used pulleys, cranes, and other heavy machinery to manipulate a spiral staircase to resemble an evergreen tree. No longer climbable, its stairs cascade around the central shaft of the sculpture like weighted tree limbs. The ribbon-like railing forms a twisting red line against the black silhouette of the sculpture. As if piercing the pavement with industrial force, <em>Fir Tree</em> (2012) conjures an image of skyscrapers with steel roots below the city.</p>
<p>
	For more than ten years, Sosnowska&rsquo;s work has explored our psychological relationship to the built environment, creating complex installations that alter our perceptions of familiar objects and spaces. Based in Warsaw, Sosnowska often works with architectural elements associated with Eastern Europe during the Soviet period. <em>Fir Tree</em> echoes the industrial steel staircases found on the exterior walls of Polish housing blocks. Here, this once-functional object refuses to serve its intended purpose. Instead it becomes an animated and outsized metaphor, testing the bounds of a familiar form as it reaches toward the urban skyline.</p>

Abraham Lincoln: War Veteran Projection,Krzysztof Wodiczko,2012-11-08,2012-12-09,South of Pavilion,"<p>The voices and images of recent veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, as well as Vietnam veterans, animate the historic bronze commemorative statue of Abraham Lincoln that has stood silently in Union Square since 1870. The sculpture by Henry Kirke Brown (who also sculpted the George Washington at the park's south plaza), was commissioned by the Union League Club, in the wake of the president's assassination, as a lasting testimonial.</p>

<p>Wodiczko interviewed 30 veterans or their family members over the course of several months for <em>Abraham Lincoln</em>, and used 14 taped conversations about their war experiences and the toll of duty on their family life. These points of views, presented in each person's own words, voice, and gestures, are projected via sound and light onto
the figure of Lincoln. </p>

St. Nicholas Park Mesh,Katherine Daniels,2012-12-13,2013-04-22,,"Katherine Daniels highlights the park&rsquo;s eclectic, though largely overlooked, history through a series three contemporary weavings on the park&rsquo;s basketball court fences. On the southern end of the park, the chain link fence hosts an abstract vine design based on Native American textiles and recounts the Indian path Weekquaeskeek, which passed along what is now St. Nicholas Avenue. The central installation of crosiers, or hooked shepherd staffs, references the park&rsquo;s namesake and the three churches that border the park. Located near the Hamilton Grange, home of founding father Alexander Hamilton, the northernmost court is adorned with a zig-zag pattern of &ldquo;quilt squares.&rdquo; This monumental brocade represents the park&rsquo;s early American history as a military campground during the Battle of Harlem Heights, where General George Washington positioned himself during the Revolutionary War in 1776.<br>",M,40.81387,-73.95086,1
Heartwalk,Situ Studio,2013-02-12,2013-03-10,between 46th-47th Streets and Broadway & 7th Avenue,"<p>Brooklyn-based design firm Situ Studio is the winner of this year's annual Times Square Valentine Heart Design. Over the last five years, the Times Square Alliance has invited architecture and design firms to submit proposals for a romantic public art installation celebrating Valentine's Day in Times Square.</p><p>Situ Studio took inspiration from the collective experience of Hurricane Sandy and the love that binds people together during trying times. Using boardwalk boards salvaged during Sandy's aftermath from Long Beach, New York; Sea Girt, New Jersey; and Atlantic City, New Jersey. <i>Heartwalk</i> begins as two ribbons of wooden planks that fluidly lift from the ground to form a heart shaped enclosure in the middle of Duffy Square. The slatted construction, illuminated from within, provides varied views of the interior as visitors move around the perimeter of the installation.</p>

United Enemies,Thomas Sch&uuml;tte,2013-03-05,2013-08-25,Doris C. Freedman Plaza,"<p>Towering in cast bronze, it is astonishing that Thomas Sch&uuml;tte&rsquo;s <i>United Enemies</i> has its origins in a series of small figures the artist made with modeling clay in the early 1990s. Sch&uuml;tte (b. 1954, Oldenburg, Germany) conceived the series during a residency in Italy at a time when several politicians had been arrested for corruption. These figures, however, are mythical characters rather than specific individuals. Their paired forms are highly abstracted, with heads emerging from swaddling robes that conceal their limbs. Faces are aged and anguished, rendered in soft focus to suggest the waning power of would-be patriarchs. In contrast, the tightly knotted rope that binds them is sharply detailed, drawing the figures &ndash; and our eyes &ndash; into focus.</p>

<p>Monumental bronze statuary is among the most traditional forms of public art. The artist&rsquo;s choice of Central Park for the display of this work places it in dialogue with that tradition. With typical inventiveness, Sch&uuml;tte has taken a conventional form and made it relevant. His colossal figures do not stand heroically atop a classical pedestal but seem to stagger, earthbound, on tripods of bundled poles. Struggling to be rid of its mate, each figure is nevertheless incapable of standing alone. They have become potent contemporary metaphors: sculpted giants that simultaneously resonate with the mythological, the political, and the personal.</p>

Organic Abstracts,Dianne Smith,2013-03-07,2013-04-15,Bartow Pell Mansion,"<p>The West Harlem Art Fund and Bartow Pell present two works by artist Dianne Smith on the grounds of this historic house. <i>The Couple</i> is two androgynous heads approximately twenty feet wide and ten feet tall. The heads rest on one another and are made from everyday discarded materials such as, packaging, paper, cans, fabric and magazines, bound together with string and rope. <i>The Couple</i> represents the idea of the environment, community and family respect. The concept of heads resting on one another, plays on the old adages &ldquo;<i>two heads are better than one</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>it takes a village</i>.&rdquo; They symbolize the idea that we all need each other and the environment to live harmonious and balanced lives. </p>
<p><i>Flying High</i> is a site specific installation constructed out of brown butcher paper. The varnished paper, hanging between two trees, is crunched, crumpled, rolled, twisted, interlocked, woven and manipulated. For Smith butcher paper is a metaphor for the treatment of people in developing countries, as well as consumption in the global market. People use butcher paper for many everyday activities and throw it away once they are done with it. Some of its uses include wrapping meat, crafting, and packing shipped.</p>

"Wayfinder, Trance Ender, Third Portal",Alan Binstock,2013-04-15,2013-09-13,,"<p>Three sculptures by artist Alan Binstock are on view in Ft. Tryon Park&mdash;<i>Wayfinder</i>, located across from the New Leaf Caf&eacute;, and <i>Third Portal</i> and <i>Trance Ender</i>, found along the Stan Michels Promenade. Made of resin, shattered tempered glass and steel, all three pieces appear to be tools offering direction or pathways to discovery and (inner) navigation. </p>
<p>These sculptures are appropriately placed along the promenade that overlooks the Heather Garden, so the natural colors of the garden are reflected in Binstock&rsquo;s luminous sculptures.</p>
<p>Alan Binstock also worked as a jeweler, carpenter, cabinetmaker, and taught yoga, verging close to a monastic life in an ashram community.  Binstock currently works as an architect at NASA&rsquo;s Goddard Space Flight Center.  He finds the continued exposure to near and deep space images, as well as Eastern metaphysics, powerful influences on his work.  <i>Wayfinder</i> borrows and interprets the forms of ancient armillaries and astrolabes, as well as Hubble imagery.  Mantras and words of peace are inscribed in the outer ring and the center is composed of shattered tempered glass and dyed resin that catches the light that shines through the trees overhead. <i>Trance Ender</i> was inspired by the idea of energy centers (chakras) referenced in Eastern philosophies. With an interest in transmitting these ideas, Binstock mimicked the form of transmission towers.  His new sculpture, <i>Third Portal</i> is also made of colorful shattered glass and caste resins that resemble the rotating cosmos. </p>",M,40.86061,-73.93316,1

Featuring nine acclaimed international artists, Busted will be on view from April 2013 to April 2014.</p>

<p>Drawing its inspiration from the dedicatory sculptures that punctuated the streets of ancient Rome,<i> Busted</i> plays with the popular tradition of urban monuments and civic landmarks that have defined public spaces for centuries. Who are today's heroes and who does the public expect to see memorialized in monuments&Alpha; <i>Busted</i> will raise some of these questions by bringing together a group of artists who are questioning the tradition of commemorative sculpture and the format of the celebratory monuments. The invited artists will touch upon &ndash; at times with levity and sense of humor &ndash; issues of democracy, taste, and representation of the self in the public space.</p>
<p><i>Busted</i> will feature nine international artists including: Frank Benson, Steven Claydon, George Condo, Mark Grotjahn, Sean Landers, Goshka Macuga, Ruby Neri, Amalia Pica,  and Andra Ursuta.</p>

INSIDE OUT NEW YORK CITY,JR,2013-04-22,2013-05-10,,"<p>Times Square Arts, the public arts program of the Times Square Alliance, welcomes French artist JR&rsquo;s global initiative INSIDE OUT PROJECT, a large-scale participatory art project he started in 2011, to Times Square from April 22 to May 10, 2013. For INSIDE OUT NEW YORK CITY, JR and his team invite New Yorkers and visitors to take self-portraits in a specially designed photo booth stationed in Times Square, the site of the world&rsquo;s first ever photo booth almost 100 years ago. The black-and-white self-portraits will be overlaid on a backdrop designed by JR and printed on the spot as a 3&rsquo;X4&rsquo; poster. The posters will be pasted on Duffy Square in Times Square, or in the home community of the portrait&rsquo;s subject. The goal of the project is to allow each portrait-taker to express through his or her face a message to the world.</p>
<p>The project will activate Times Square as a creative hub&mdash;engaging the boroughs of New York as the photo booth truck makes early visits to the Bronx, Staten Island, Queens, and Brooklyn. The initial portraits will feature community members from New York City neighborhoods affected by Hurricane Sandy&mdash;the Staten Island waterfront, the Rockaways, Red Hook, and Coney Island.</p>

Centrally located in Tribeca Park (also known as Beach Street Park), this sculpture will brighten the heavily canopied plaza.  Smith, who exhibited her sculpture Leaning Firm in Brooklyn&rsquo;s Columbus Park in 2007, also explores similar themes in her photographic prints. </p>",M,40.72015,-74.00552,1
LOTUS,Jaehyo Lee,2013-05-01,2013-10-01,,"<p>Jaehyo Lee&rsquo;s continues his signature use of crosscuts of Korean big-cone pine. For this work, the artist meticulously carved, shaped, and burned the circular wood slabs that are attached to a steel armature reminiscent of an 18-foot tall champagne flute. Lee is particularly interested in highlighting the &ldquo;beauty in what is seen but not noticed.&rdquo; <i>LOTUS</i> is a minimalistic approach to a monumental sculpture that exposes the nature of his materials, including the natural texture and character of the wood grain. Lee&rsquo;s is the eighteenth public artwork to be exhibited in Union Square Park, seven of which including LOTUS at the southeast triangle. </p>

Hosea,Carole Eisner,2013-04-29,2014-04-25,,"<p>Visible to Roosevelt Island Tram riders, Queensborough Bridge commuters, and pedestrians, Hosea, a 15 foot tall steel and iron sculpture, features an enormous railroad gear that is supported by a tripod of wavy steel legs. This gear refers beautifully to the working yellow gear in the mechanical section of the tram, clearly visible from the park. Eisner found the gear in a scrap yard and placed it at the apex of the sculpture to &ldquo;celebrate its form and strength,&rdquo; rather than its industrial past.  The three legs straddle the decorative paved element in the center of the park and allow ample space for viewers to perambulate under and around the sculpture. </p>

Following its New York run, the installation will travel to the deCordova Sculpture Park and Museum outside of Boston in October 2013, marking the first Mad. Sq. Art commission to tour.</p>
<p>Genger&rsquo;s work artfully transcends the perceived limits of the materials she employs. This Mad. Sq. Art commission consists of 1.4 million feet of rope&mdash;the total length equating to nearly 20 times the length of Manhattan&mdash;covered in over 3,000 gallons of paint, and weighing over an astounding 100,000 pounds. <i>Red, Yellow and Blue</i> employs repurposed rope collected from hundreds of miles up and down the Eastern seaboard, bringing elements of the coastline to the urban setting of Madison Square Park. Together, three separate undulating structures of layered rope shaped on-site by the artist redefines the landscape of the park, creating interactive environments that invite visitors to explore both exposed and hidden spaces, encouraging them to navigate and experience Madison Square Park anew.</p>

Individuals,Andrew Rogers,2013-05-07,2013-09-13,,"<i>Individuals</i> is composed of 15 bronze sculptures that are all unique, but similar in form. Made specifically for the park, &ldquo;these individual figurative forms come together as a close community, yet it is always to be remembered that it is the individual that makes our world a place of justice and compassion,&rdquo; says Andrew Rogers.&nbsp; It is a particularly apt theme that resonates with this location, the gateway for the United Nations. Rogers uses bronze for these twelve-foot individuals, a material weighted in the history of art, but used in a light, contemporary manner for this exhibition. The organic, ribbed outer surfaces act as counterpoints to the delicate, highly polished sculpture interiors.

<p> High  Line Art presents <em>Caterpillar</em> by artist Carol Bove, a  HIGH LINE COMMISSION featuring seven sculptures that punctuate the wild  landscape on the High Line at the Rail Yards, the third and final section of  the High Line. Bove&rsquo;s commission is the last opportunity to see this section of  the elevated railway in its natural state before it opens as public parkland in  2014. The commission will be viewable during public walks on Thursdays,  Fridays, and Saturdays until May 2014. Advance reservations are required.  Admission is free and reservations can be made <a href=""http://carolbovecaterpillar.eventbrite.com/"">online</a>.</p>
<p>For  the High Line, Bove continues her research on the role and function of art in  the public space, by creating seven new sculptures which are installed within  the self-seeded landscape on the High Line at the Rail Yards. Bove&rsquo;s  site-specific installation highlights the uniqueness of its location and opens  a magical environment for viewers. Installed along a 300-yard stretch of the  untouched terrain of the High Line, Bove&rsquo;s sculptures reveal themselves among  the unruly vegetation, like mysteriously pristine ruins of a lost civilization  or a contemporary version of a Zen garden. Abstract shapes and enigmatic forms  are carefully placed along the High Line, creating a unique viewing experience  surrounded by the wilderness of the High Line and the stunning views of the  Hudson River.</p>

  Heartwalk- the 30-foot heart constructed from Hurricane Sandy  salvaged boardwalk in the Rockaways and Atlantic City- embodies the collective  experience of Hurricane Sandy and the love that binds people together during  trying times. Whether it was the radically reconfigured landscapes, the  compromised infrastructural networks, or the temporary solutions that emerged  in the days and weeks that followed the storm, Hurricane Sandy confronted all  New Yorkers and New Jerseyans by transforming the familiar.

<p>The sculpture was created by an international team of seven selected League students during a nine-month program led by master sculptor Greg Wyatt.

Inner Space Station,Can Altay,2013-05-10,2013-06-30,,"<p>Can Altay's <i>Inner Space Station</i>, 2013, is a territorial marker in the form of a circular bench. Altay's work draws on the limits of public space by creating a temporary inner space that is a simple gesture towards introspection. <i>Inner Space Station</i> is a circle, approximately six feet in diameter, made of concrete, just high and deep enough to make a quiet park bench. Regardless of the direction one is facing while sitting on the sculpture, there is the unavoidable aspect of positioning oneself either on the inside or on the outside. This simple gesture of proposing a boundary as a resting place expands to wider philosophical concerns of what is permitted, where and when. </p>

Broadway Billboard: Her Nuclear Waters,Chitra Ganesh,2013-05-12,2013-08-05,,"<p><i>Her Nuclear Waters</i>, an 11' x 28' image by artist Chitra Ganesh, is the newest installment of the Park&rsquo;s ongoing Broadway Billboard series. Chitra Ganesh&rsquo;s drawing-based practice seeks to excavate buried narratives typically excluded from official canons of history, literature, and art. Her installation, text-based work, and collaborations dissect mythologies and layer disparate visual languages, inviting the viewer to consider alternate narratives of femininity, sexuality, and power as untold stories rise to the surface. Ganesh&rsquo;s works harness a broad range of visual referents, drawing equally from German expressionism and Japanese woodblock prints, and contemporary visual idioms such as psychedelic print culture, anime, and comics. Her projects are also shaped via an engagement with literary narrative in its many forms:  folk and fairy tales, song lyrics, science fiction, and mythology. In this process, the figures is fractured, multiplied, obscured, and distorted, offering points of rupture as potent sites of social and sexual transgression, contemplation, and transformation. </p>

Beyond the Hedges (Slivered Gazebo),Heather Rowe,2013-05-12,2013-07-07,,"<p>Brooklyn-based sculptor Heather Rowe investigates the transitional space between architecture, sculpture, and installation through perspectival framing, formal inversion, and material deconstruction.  Rowe's latest work, <i>Beyond the Hedges (Slivered Gazebo)</i>, is a site-specific installation of mirrors, corridors, and spatial slices presented at Socrates Sculpture Park; it is her first outdoor public artwork.</p>
 
<p><i>Beyond the Hedges (Slivered Gazebo)</i> inverts the routine relationships we have with our surroundings by restructuring the familiar and reimagining architectural experiences. While many experience architecture in a state of distraction, <i>Beyond the Hedges</i> invites us to focus beyond our current space. Rowe interprets the traditional gazebo or trellis&mdash;structures typically placed within a park to frame picturesque views&mdash;as a sliced and cropped dimensional space that, sandwiched between pieces of plywood, becomes the framed view. Inspired by Peter Joel Harrison&rsquo;s illustrated book Gazebos and Trellises, the plywood shapes suspend fragile moments of the garden pavilion, frozen in precarious states of decay or undoing. Complicating the internal network of latticework are mirrored insertions, offering an active relationship to the natural surrounds and Park visitors.</p>

Although these new works are not technically site-specific, I have placed each one where it can bring into focus the ambiance of the location. A horizontal sculpture will be situated opposite the Seagram Building, for example, accentuating the open plaza areas of the site.

After documenting notable forms and architecture around the park, Rekevics created a series of wooden molds that combine recognizable elements in altered scales. The monumental All-Too-Familiar Tangle references the wooden bollards that line the coast near the Staten Island Ferry, as well as the neo-classical limestone columns and rounded portico entryway of the landmarked Staten Island Savings Bank located at 81 Water Street. Further investigation reveals the dormer window details from the park&rsquo;s historic Village Hall conflated with the defining form of the sculpture&mdash;a wall-like structure with three peaks and low windows that echoes the distinctive pink design that covers the face of 7 Beach Street.</p>

Abstract and figurative, classic and contemporary, Gus and Lina Ocamposilva&rsquo;s sculptures are made of strong aluminum, but appear soft and fluid. The bended forms incorporate tubes, exposed bolts, stippled texture and brilliant yellow, cobalt blue, teal and red coloring.

The sculpture, titled <i>Serendipity</i>, is a life-size, steel silhouette of a formerly homeless man who spent much of his time in the park. The exhibition will be located near the western entrance at St. Mark&rsquo;s Place and Avenue A and is on view through November 2013. </p>

<p>Allie visited Tompkins Square to prepare for the exhibition and find a regular park visitor to serve as the model for her piece. Instead the model found her. Christopher Gamble approached Allie and struck up a conversation.  They later met for coffee where he revealed he was previously homeless for 28 years and frequented the park. Gamble agreed to model for the sculpture. The steel figure stands with its face looking up to the sky, shoulders and arms outreached, preparing to take flight. Allie interprets the piece as a symbol of hope and the desire to strive for something greater. In a series of recent works, she has focused on the human body, with a particular interest in its outline. By removing the center of the figure, she plays with ideas of memory and the mark we leave on places and others.

Lightness of Being,Various Artists,2013-07-25,2013-12-13,,"<p>Lightness of Being is a new group exhibition featuring a multigenerational, international group of 11 artists whose work displays a playful and irreverent attitude toward the formal ideals of classical sculpture. The artists featured in the exhibition are Cristian Andersen, James Angus, Daniel Buren, Olaf Breuning, Alex Hubbard, Evan Holloway, Alicja Kwade, Sarah Lucas, Ugo Rondinone, David Shrigley, Gary Webb, and Franz West. </p>

<p>At once lighthearted and enigmatic, the works in this show incorporate an engaging sense of play and wry humor. Everyday objects shift in scale to become larger than life or lose their functionality altogether; art historical references are transformed with a sense of wit and whimsy; and brightly colored objects and unusual forms bring a sense of levity. On view through December 13, 2013, the exhibition features new commissions, major works being shown publicly in New York for the first time, and a weekly performance.</p>

<p>Jade Chan's design for the Rockaway barriers is titled In Flight. When she visited Rockaway Beach, she was inspired by the warmth, the sun and the colors that jumped out at her from the sky, water and sand. The sound of the surf and the breeze upon her skin was exhilarating. She observed the birds in flight and was inspired by this free and liberating vision. Chan sees In Flight as a representation of the freedom and strength of the human spirit. </p><p>Learn more about the <a href=""/art-and-antiquities/rockaway-beautification"">Rockaway Barrier Beautification Project</a>.</p>",Q,40.5882,-73.8119,1

<p>As an artist, Patty Harris has created animations of floods and is fascinated by the way water moves. Experienced in looking closely at the sea, she pulled a few simple forms that suggest the movement and pattern of a wave. For the Shore Parkway barrier, Patty painted shapes that express the undulating movement of a wave. She added curved shapes that hold water of a slightly different color&mdash;just as actual water displays a range of hues. To this rhythmical simple pattern, Harris included the silhouetted forms of surfers at the crests of the waves.</p>

Harvest Dome 2.0,Amanda Schachter & Alexander Levi,2013-08-01,2013-08-31,,"<p>Amanda Schachter and Alexander Levi gathered discarded storm-snapped umbrellas, littered seasonally throughout Manhattan for the Harvest Dome 2.0. They assembled them into a giant twenty-four foot diameter, light-gauge spherical dome, which floats on the waters of the Inwood Hill Park Inlet as a physical revelation of the city&rsquo;s accumulated waterborne debris. The inlet, a remnant of Spuyten Duyvil Creek&rsquo;s marshland, was reconfigured and dredged in 1895 to create the Harlem River Ship Canal. It holds brackish water and is home to saltwater cord grass, a species particularly adept at trapping flotsam and converting it into the nutrient-rich mud called detritus that supports abundant life on the marsh. Harvest Dome reveals and transfigures the workings of this ecosystem at Manhattan&rsquo;s northern tip, which was once prevalent on the island. It calls attention to the particularities of its tides&mdash;which reveal the mud flats twice daily&mdash;through hands-on engagement with the water and the real-time harvesting of the city&rsquo;s manufactured debris into a large-scale curiosity of urban nature. </p>",M,40.8723,-73.9259,1

The 12 x 12 Project,World Policy Institute,2013-08-06,2013-09-01,,"<p>The 12x12 Project originated from a book by author and World Policy Insitute Senior Fellow, William Powers. Powers chronicled his season living in a ""tiny house"" in the 2010 award-winning, national ""green living"" bestseller: Twelve by Twelve: A One Room Cabin, Off the Grid &amp; Beyond the American Dream. Inspired by the book, artists Betsy Damon, Simon Draper, Erik Ajemian and Christy Rupp formed a creative team to engage the public in dialogue about how smarter consumption might change their lives - and the planet. The 12x12 installation is a simple space that houses panels containing text and questions from the Twelve by Twelve book. Participants and park visitors to the installation will engage with the question ""What's your 12x12&Alpha;"" in order to spark new thinking around what smart consumption means for each person. Throughout the exhibition there will be a series of artists in residence which will include Ivy Haldeman, Mario Chamorro, Catalina Parra, Pablo Gnecco, Jonathan Koh, and Shawn Shafner.</p>

Playground,Iran do Espirito Santo,2013-09-10,2014-02-16,Doris C. Freedman Plaza,"<p>One of Brazil&rsquo;s most highly  regarded contemporary artists, Iran do Esp&iacute;rito Santo (b. 1963) is known for  his austere yet sensuous drawings, wall paintings, and sculptures. <em>Playground</em> is his first public work in the United States. At first glance it looks like a  massive cube made from large stone blocks &ndash; but with a number of blocks missing  at the corners. On closer examination it becomes evident that the work hasn&rsquo;t  been constructed out of individual elements but rather cast in stone-like  concrete as a unified form. We see that the &ldquo;mortar&rdquo; is exactly the same as the  &ldquo;block&rdquo; itself and that the entire sculpture is consistent in color, texture,  and finish. The &ldquo;missing&rdquo; corner elements were never there but are instead  deliberately composed openings that allow transparency and access to the  interior space. </p>
  <p>Do Esp&iacute;rito Santo speaks of the work as a kind of &ldquo;idealized ruin&rdquo; that is also  a metaphorical playground. As a child the artist loved to play with building  blocks. Given its architectural materials and oversized scale, <em>Playground</em> is a bit like a blown up cartoon image of a child&rsquo;s fantasy building. At the same  time, the artist has created a subtle and elegant play between perception and  reality, construction and destruction, and between idealized form and everyday  objects and materials. </p>

Rather than being a thematic exhibition, each artist has a distinct  artwork (and in some cases performance) that embodies his or her innovative  exploration of sculpture.</p>

Ideas of Stone,Giuseppe Penone,2013-09-26,2014-02-09,,"<p>Three 30-foot tall bronze trees by renowned Italian artist  Giuseppe Penone are now installed in Madison Square Park. <em>Ideas of Stone (Idee di pietra),</em> featuring Penone&rsquo;s  signature manipulation of the trees&rsquo; natural forms, will interact with the  park&rsquo;s lush landscape to highlight the relationships amongst man, sculpture and  nature. The installation will remain on view daily from September 26, 2013  through February 9, 2014 in Madison Square Park.</p>
<p>  Throughout his 40&ndash;year career, Penone has employed natural  materials and forms in an exploration of the contrasting and fundamental  relationships between man and nature. Penone was a member of the Italian <em>Arte Povera</em> movement,  which was comprised of artists who sought to dissolve divisions between art and  life by using commonplace subjects and materials in their work. Trees as living  sculpture is a recurring theme for Penone. He often manipulates these natural  forms by twisting, deconstructing, hollowing, and uprooting the organic  figures. He incorporates traces of fingerprints, nails, wires, carvings, and  precariously placed boulders as remnant evidence of the sculptures&rsquo; manmade  composition and the effect of human interaction with the natural world. Penone  addresses concepts of weight, balance, and scale, while merging the manmade and  the organic.</p>

Bird God Drone,Nick Hornby,2013-11-01,2014-10-31,,"<p>In Hornby&rsquo;s <em>Bird God Drone</em>,  the outline of Michelangelo&rsquo;s <em>David</em> &ndash; one of the most famous and widely reproduced sculptures in the world &ndash; has been extruded vertically over 12 feet to converge at a single point.  In <em>Bird God Drone</em>, the silhouette of  David&rsquo;s conquering and classical Renaissance body lies horizontally, flush with  the ground, and visible from above: by workers peering out of windows, tourists  crossing the Brooklyn Bridge, birds, gods, and drones. </p>
<p>The sculpture is robotically carved from a synthetic composite to the  accuracy of a fraction of a millimeter. The figurative perfection of  Michelangelo&rsquo;s sculpture is juxtaposed against the Platonic ideal of geometry. </p>
<p>  Hornby has derived his outline, not from the original marble carving,  but from a white plaster copy from the late 1800s located in the Victoria and  Albert Museum in London. Here, in Brooklyn, Hornby&rsquo;s sculpture is repositioned  in another historical moment of belief in technological progress. It is no  longer God and nature alone that view from above, but also drones and  satellites, the components of our industrialization of space.</p>
<p>Accompanying this sculpture is a video of the work shot from above by a  surveillance drone. The sculpture is designed specifically for this bird&rsquo;s-eye  view, inverting the &lsquo;man on a plinth&rsquo; monument which is traditionally viewed  from <em>below</em>.&nbsp;The video will be available  on YouTube, accessible via smart-phones, and disseminated by social media,  revealing Michelangelo&rsquo;s outline dropped like a Google pin point (the hallmark  of contemporary travel) in the urban landscape. <a href=""http://www.birdgoddrone.com"">www.birdgoddrone.com</a></p>

These ancestral totems  have been the essence of family and tribal identity. Alpert&rsquo;s totems, first  modeled in clay and then cast in bronze, read abstractly but also suggest  recognizable, organic forms: an eagle form seems to emerge from the top of one,  and human shapes surface in others. These sometimes sensuous, abstract  structures and the artist&rsquo;s creative process are fluid like jazz, making  intangible compositions physical. Alpert, a leading musician, composer, and  music producer makes connections between the fluid nature of his sculpture and  his intuitive approach to music.</p>

The artist takes the exhibition&rsquo;s title from the beloved 1940 Woody Guthrie folk song, which is both an American anthem and a vocal pull to the freedoms offered in this country for an immigrant population. The towers are elevated to a height above visitors&rsquo; heads, allowing them to walk underneath and look up into each sculpture to view the content within. </p><p>Navarro&rsquo;s water towers&mdash;each measuring approximately seven feet in diameter and standing on roughly eight-foot-tall supports&mdash;will function as vessels for a vocabulary of the political and personal experience of immigration. The interior of one tower will feature the words &ldquo;me&rdquo; and &ldquo;we&rdquo;, another will feature the word &ldquo;bed&rdquo;, and a third will display the image of a ladder&mdash;all of which will be composed of neon light. An internal arrangement of mirrors will enable each word or image to repeat perpetually through a seemingly endless vertical space.</p><p>This exhibition is presented by the Madison Square Park Conservancy. </p>",M,40.7428,-73.98784,1

Over the  last six years the Times Square Alliance has invited architecture and design  firms to submit proposals for a romantic public art installation celebrating  Valentine&rsquo;s Day in Times Square. For the 2014 competition, Times Square Arts,  in collaboration with <a href=""http://www.vanalen.org/"">Van  Alen Institute</a>, selected Young Projects&rsquo; <em>Match-Maker</em> out of six  design proposals.</p>
<p><em>Match-Maker</em> cosmically connects people this  Valentine&rsquo;s Day. Guided by their zodiac signs, visitors arrange themselves at  twelve viewing points around the heart-shaped sculpture. Peering through  colorful, interwoven periscopes provides glimpses of each viewer&rsquo;s four most  ideal astrological mates, offering potentially novel connections between lonely  souls or settled lovers. The form of the sculpture is elusive, complex and  symmetrical, and changes as viewers experience it from different vantage points  throughout Times Square. From many points of view it forms a perfect and iconic  heart; from other perspectives the sculpture is tangled and perplexing.</p>

<p> A massive 60-foot edifice comprised of an overlapping tower and pyramid create  a temporary gateway to Bryant Park.

Park Avenue Paper Chase,Alice Aycock,2014-03-08,2014-07-20,,"<p><em>Park  Avenue Paper Chase</em>, a series of seven sculptures by artist Alice Aycock,  grace the canyons of Manhattan this spring and summer. Six works are on view  between 52nd and 57th Streets and a seventh work is at Park Avenue and 66th Street  in front of the Park Avenue Armory. Aycock has long been one of very few women  exploring the relationship between structure, site, and viewer on an  architectural scale, like her peers Richard Serra and Mark di Suvero.</p>
<p>Ranging in  size from 12 to 27 feet in height 18 to 70 feet in length, the aluminum and  fiberglass works in the new installation forms an arresting presence in the  heart of midtown Manhattan. According to Aycock &ldquo;I tried to visualize the  movement of wind energy as it flowed up and down the avenue creating random  whirlpools, touching down here and there and sometimes forming dynamic  three-dimensional massing of forms. The sculptural assemblages suggest waves,  wind turbulence, turbines, and vortexes of energy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many of the  new works incorporate images of wheels and turbines and references to energy in  the form of spirals, whirlwinds, whirlpools, spinning tops, and whirly-gigs.  One of the works references the expressive quality of wind through drapery and  the chaotic beauty of flow dynamics. The sculptures can be read from both sides  of the avenue and the visual narrative plays to both the uptown and downtown movement  of traffic patterns. Aycock continues &ldquo;As much as the sculptures are obviously  placed on the mall, I wanted the work to have a random, haphazard quality &ndash; in  some cases, piling up on itself, with others spinning off into the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sculpture  locations include <em>Maelstrom</em> at 52nd-53rd  Street; <em>Hoop-La</em> at 53rd  Street; <em>Twin Vortexes</em> at 54th  Street, <em>Spin-The-Spin </em>at 55th  Street; <em>Waltzing Matilda</em> at 56th  Street; <em>Cyclone Twist </em>at 57th  Street and <em>Super Twister III</em> at 66th  Street.</p>",M,40.75981,-73.97213,1

<p>Creating a  majestic, awe&ndash;inspiring atmosphere in Bryant Park, <em>The Kelpies</em> are the original 1:10 scale design models of Andy&rsquo;s  100&ndash;foot&ndash;tall sculptures located in the heart of the new 900 acre Helix  Parkland in Falkirk, central Scotland.</p>
<p>With one  horse rearing up and the other at rest, a dramatic sense of motion is  created.&nbsp; The sculptures are made from  hundreds of small pieces of steel plate painstakingly welded to create the  forms. <em>The Kelpies </em>were then  galvanized, a process that involves dipping the sculptures in baths of molten  zinc.&nbsp;&nbsp; The full scale sculptures are now  among the largest equine artworks in the world.</p>
<p>Inspiration  for this work came from the Clydesdale horses that, for centuries, pulled boats  and cargo along the towpaths of the Forth &amp; Clyde and Union Canals in  Scotland.&nbsp; </p>

Depicting a crowded dance hall  bordered by quilted hand-dyed fabrics, <em>Groovin&rsquo; High</em> is evocative of  Ringgold&rsquo;s interest and activism in the African American communities of her  native Harlem. Her style reflects formal treatments of shape, color, and  perspective reminiscent of many painters whose styles defined the Harlem  Renaissance, an immensely productive and creative cultural movement of the  1920s that erupted out of the African American community living in the  eponymous New York neighborhood.</p>

Archeo,Various Artists,2014-04-17,2015-03-31,,"<p>An outdoor group exhibition about technology and obsolescence, <em>Archeo</em> brings together the work of artists who employ outmoded technologies and outdated machinery as a reflection on humanity&rsquo;s continuous fascination and frustration with technology.</p>
<p> Today, many young artists engage with technology by exposing both its fragilities and merits. Their artworks embody an attitude that is simultaneously critical and nostalgic, in which the optimistic idealism of technological progress is countered by a disenchanted skepticism. Some of the works in the exhibition describe a recent past which resembles a dystopian future, featuring a wasteland of discarded machines and castaway objects. Other artists are more enthusiastic about the potential of technology but warn us against its dangerous side effects and its planned obsolescence. Some of the artworks on view disclose a return to the handmade and an attraction to organic forms and materials. These sculptures resemble relics and findings of an archaeology of the future. </p>

Feinstein&rsquo;s sculptures are executed  in graphically printed and detailed panels of thin metal, ranging from eight to  26 feet tall. The three structures include a house perched on a towering cliff,  a Rococo-style hut, and a flying ship moored high in a tree, supported by a  mast extending to the ground. </p>
<p>  Best known for her fanciful  sculptures, Feinstein&rsquo;s stage-set follies for Mad. Sq. Art are made of  powder-coated aluminum with applied surface illustration. They are not  inhabitable as the works are sculptural reliefs: they have active,  three-dimensional facades and flat backs with structural supports. Installed on  three park lawns, the structures will evoke theatrical scenery in which the  park visitors are the actors.</p>

In <i>Bearlike Construction</i>, the form is immediately recognizable as a teddy bear, but is assembled out of cast bronze garbage bags rather than the conventional soft fur.

THINK BIG,Jim Rennert,2014-06-03,2015-05-04,,"<p>Jim Rennert&rsquo;s<em> THINK BIG </em>stands at over 12-feet tall  serving as an inspiration to everyone who works hard every day to achieve their  dreams and goals. The monumental businessman gazes up at the sky and the  Manhattan skyline, reminding us that if we &ldquo;think big&rdquo; we can attain anything  and that the American Dream is still very much alive and possible. Businessman  or not, everyone can still relate to the themes in their own personal ways. <em>THINK BIG i</em>s the culmination of positive  thinking, as the original concept started as a two-inch sculpture. Rennert is  excited to bring the sculpture to New York so that everyone can indeed, &ldquo;think  big.&rdquo;</p>

Outer Seed Shadow #01,Juanli Carrion,2014-06-04,2014-11-15,,"<p>Outer Seed Shadow #01 was conceived by Spanish artist Juanli  Carri&oacute;n in 2012 when after years of living in New York he started to consider  permanent residence in the United States.   He wanted to revisit the long-established idea of the American &ldquo;melting  pot&rdquo; and investigate the new realities of immigrant life in 2014, particularly  in New York, the most symbolic of immigrant cities.  Carri&oacute;n conducted a series of on-camera  interviews with immigrants living throughout Manhattan about their personal  experiences of arriving to the city.  At  the end of the discussion, each interviewee selected a plant that exists both  in their country of origin and in the United States, which represents both them  and their community in the public  garden.</p>
<p> The 1,000 square foot garden is in the shape of Manhattan  and features dozens of plants selected by immigrants living in the borough.  Placed according to the interviewees&rsquo; real-life locations on the island, the  plants represent the diversity of the city. The garden will host a series of  free public programs beginning June 7 that includes artist-led tours, lectures,  hands-on garden workshops and &ldquo;Open Garden&rdquo; days.

<p>  Travieso&rsquo;s  project <em>On  a Fence</em> expands  on his 2013 Pier 42 project, which transforms the fence surrounding Pier 42  into an interactive structure incorporating seating, play areas, and signage.  The project seeks to invert the function and meaning of the fence from a  physical barrier to a place where people can come together. This year, <em>On a Fence</em> will be expanded to  occupy the entire length of the fence on the Northern side of the park,  incorporating new programming that complements the previous installation.</p>
<p><em>On a Fence</em> acts as a testing ground and  incubator for more permanent solutions that can be incorporated into the final  design of the Pier 42 Park. Local residents participate in the planning and  design process of <em>On a Fence</em> and assist in its construction on site.</p>

<p>  Combo Colab conceived the installation as a  social sculpture that uses existing resources, low-cost materials, and  pre-fabricated systems. It can be read as an inhabitable barrier that also acts  as an island for play, incorporating interactive elements to engage visitors.  Sound-making features by Stereotank promote a participative mood creating  awareness about water and marine life. <em>DrumReef 42</em> is an experiment on subjects that are relevant to the site, the neighborhood,  and its condition in proximity to the water.</p>

<p>Davis&rsquo; project <em>The  People&rsquo;s Poster Project</em> redefines  the notion of a time capsule. Instead of burying something in the ground to be  excavated thousands of years in the future, the project aims to activate a more  reflective space that highlights individual stories of Lower East Side  residents within public dialogue about the future of Pier 42.</p>
<p>The project consists of workshops and  conversations about what matters most to Lower East Side community members.  Working with a range of community groups, from youth to elders, Davis will  facilitate large format photographic portraits, inviting neighbors to pose with  an object from their personal archive and recount its significance. Throughout  the summer they will create and install posters in local community spaces and  businesses around the neighborhood, and on Pier 42, culminating in a completed  outdoor exhibition in September.</p>

The seven sculptures, ranging in size from 8 to 20 feet in  height, were created especially for the Park Avenue installation using a unique  vacuum process, which &ldquo;implodes&rdquo; geometric shapes causing the material to  deform according to natural laws.</p>
<p>Hilgemann&rsquo;s &ldquo;implosion&rdquo; process begins by fabricating perfect,  geometrically pure stainless steel forms, which are meticulously welded and  polished to satin gloss. After the pieces are complete, the artist slowly pulls  the air out with a vacuum pump, putting the natural atmospheric pressure to  sculptural use and collapsing the forms into their final shape. In a delicate  balance of planning and chance each piece acquires individual character demonstrating  unexpected and striking possibilities of the material.</p>

Wall Bearer,Kate Gilmore,2014-09-07,2015-03-22,,"<p>Kate Gilmore&rsquo;s sculptural and performance-based works raise  questions about feminine identity and contemporary power dynamics. Wall Bearer,  the park&rsquo;s current Broadway Billboard, is documentation from the eponymous  performance at The Weatherspoon Art Museum in Greensboro North Carolina in  2011. For that project, six performers, dressed in identical pink outfits,  stood in individual alcoves within a matching pink wall.&Atilde;&Alpha;&Alpha;&Atilde;&Alpha;&Acirc;  The performers, all women, stood perfectly  still for three hour stretches, during which time visitors to the exhibition  could walk through the space, viewing the performance as a still-life or a  sculpture to be briefly admired.</p>
<p> In Wall Bearer, the live female body is transformed into a  sculptural element, referencing 1970&rsquo;s performance art and later feminist  artworks.&Atilde;&Alpha;&Alpha;&Atilde;&Alpha;&Acirc;  Here Gilmore presents a parade  of pink and a rotating cast of all-female performers. The pink&rsquo;s  Pepto-Bismol-like hue borders on saccharine and feels imposed and thus  unattractively burdensome for each woman. Camouflaged, anonymous, and  uncomfortable, each woman may be a column of support and essential to the  overall tableau, but she is also easily overlooked, suggesting that there is  more than a physical wall to be overcome.</p>

The Dance,DB Lampman,2014-09-15,2015-09-14,,"<p><em>The Dance</em> consists of five figures floating 15 feet above the ground. The figures, formed with steel and wrapped in nylon, hold hands and dance whimsically within a rectangular steel structure.&nbsp; At night the figures light up and cast a glow around the neighboring trees. <em>The Dance</em> is inspired by Henri Matisse&rsquo;s painting by the same name. Similar interlocked figures can be found throughout art history, including Mayan art, African tribal sculptures, and ancient Mesopotamia, among others, to symbolize family, community, and spiritual or universal connectivity. Lampman uses this symbol for the coming together of the Staten Island community.</p>

<p>Lampman lives and works in Stapleton and has embraced the diverse community made up of residents from around the world. There is a large population from Shri Lanka, as well as immigrants from Liberia, Ghana, the Gold Coast, Mexico, and Central and South America. &nbsp;In the exhibition, the five figures are entwined in a dance&mdash;they could be Flamenco dancers from Mexico, Kandyan dancers from Sri Lanka, or&nbsp; a dance from West Africa such as the Yankadi, or the Makru.</p>

<p>Tappen Park and many other Staten Island neighborhoods were flooded during Hurricane Sandy, and sadly lives and homes were lost in the storm.&nbsp; However, Staten Island came together during this crisis&mdash;strangers dropped everything and join people from around the island and all over the world to rebuild the community. &nbsp;The neighborhood&rsquo;s joint effort is an integral part of the inspiration for Lampman&rsquo;s public artwork.&nbsp; Additionally, Lampman hopes that the installation will inspire additional community development, as the informal pavilion can be used for public dance and music performances by community members.</p>",R,40.6269,-74.07717,1

Cragg&rsquo;s sculpture is characterized by  repeated facial profiles and torqueing imagery that reshapes the experienced  world. These forms intermingle to create vital objects where contours shift and  morph, provoking the viewer to differentiate between a work of humanism and a  work of dynamism.</p>
<p> Installed on the west gravel section  of the Park, Cragg&rsquo;s <em>Caldera</em> is a strapping, tumultuous  sculpture that rests on three points. Viewers will have the opportunity to walk  beneath the work to experience its massive presence. At eighteen feet  high, <em>Mixed Feelings</em> will command a northern lawn. Three times  human height, the object is simultaneously immense and elegant. <em>Points  of View</em> is a tripartite work of sinuous forms which interact with one  another and with the viewer on the Park&rsquo;s Oval Lawn. Facial profiles zig and  zag across each column&rsquo;s surface. All three sculptures in this exhibition were  cast specifically for Madison Square Park.</p>

This new project extends the artist&rsquo;s own traditional treatment of materials,  by integrating organic elements such as seeds, vegetables, and other perishable  components inspired by the natural landscape on the High Line as well as  non-perishable items such as clothing, sneakers, and rope.

Txiti Hitkuk,Anthony Heinz May,2014-10-05,2015-09-20,,"<p>Heinz May&rsquo;s site specific installations are created with trees that have been uprooted or removed from public spaces. <em>Txiti H&igrave;tkuk</em> consists of a London Plane tree appropriated from NYC Parks.  Heinz May transplanted the trunk in the planting bed alongside existing rose bushes and London Plane trees and pixelated its appearance into a cluster of wooden cubes. The tree trunk, though untouched at its base, starts to fragment into numerous blocks that are held together with a pin system. </p>
<p>Through his sculpture, Heinz May addresses the dialogue between preservation and degradation; real and artificial; and obsoletion and sustainability. Additionally, he draws parallels between our society and its growing use of technology with his transformation of raw materials into a gridded system. He alters the recycled trees into a three-dimensional representations of two-dimensional organization found in digital imagery---noting that they act like &ldquo;dissolving digitized glitches in the landscape, symbolizing human interaction within nature through a technological lens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While researching the Lenape and the Wickquasgeck Trail (an early north-south trading route in what is now Manhattan), Heinz May came across an online translator for Unami/Delaware languages. &nbsp;The title,<em> Txiti H&igrave;tkuk</em> (pronunciation 'Touee-tee Heet-kook') roughly translates to &ldquo;Few Trees,&rdquo; which references the city as it is now in relation to how it was then.</p>

Blind Portraits,Sui Jianguo,2014-10-28,2015-02-20,Doris C. Freedman Plaza,"<p>These monumental cast bronzes are not portraits in the traditional sense. All of them have features that resemble faces, but none depict specific people. This is not surprising given that they were enlarged from small clay models created by Sui Jianguo while blindfolded. The &ldquo;portraits&rdquo; are the intuitive results of the artist manipulating his material without the benefit of sight. </p>
<p> For Sui, this apparent limitation is a means of finding a different &ndash; and equally valid &ndash; method of creating sculpture.

<p>Placed in Dag Hammarskj&ouml;ld Plaza, on East 47th  Street between First and Second Avenues, they bring to New York City Juan Soriano&rsquo;s unique perspective on art and  society. Inspired by the popular and indigenous arts of Mexico, he drew on Cubism, German Expressionism, Fauvism and the Paris artists of the interwar  period.  His individuality is clearly on  view in the three sculptures now in New York.</p>

Gazing Globes,Paula Hayes,2015-02-19,2015-04-19,,"<p><em>Gazing  Globes</em> features eighteen crystal  balls that hold the detritus of contemporary culture, including used batteries,  computer parts, and other remnants of technology sprinkled with fairy dust made  of pulverized CDs.</p>
<p>The winter months are the perfect  time to view Paula Hayes&rsquo;s <em>Gazing Globes</em> exhibition, which is  made up of eighteen transparent spheres that hold the detritus of contemporary  culture. The globes, says Hayes, will give the park &ldquo;an arctic feeling, a  winter wonderland.&rdquo; Formed into beauteous objects, Hayes&rsquo; crystal balls  positioned on elegant fiberglass pedestals summon the present and predict the  future. Each see-through globe lit from within will house used batteries,  tossed-out computer parts, castoff electronic transistor parts, vacuum tubes,  shredded rubber tires and recycled plastic flotsam. To these mixed remnants of  technology and culture the artist adds crystals and minerals. A shimmering  fairy dust made from pulverized CDs will coat the bottom and sides of each  sculpture&rsquo;s interior. Hayes, who typically works with varieties of plant  materials, is determined that everyday castoffs are indicative of a society&rsquo;s  behavior and value system and symptomatic of the current landscape.</p>
<p>Gazing globes are a decorative form  first used in outdoor gardens in the Middle Ages. These orbs were made of  hand-blown glass, and were considered to hold magical power and to foster good  luck or ward off evil. Hayes conjures the mystical character of the historic  object but makes the form fully contemporary as she creates work with  present-day scrutiny and a nod to clairvoyance.</p>

HeartBeat,Stereotank,2015-02-09,2015-03-08,,"<p>This sculpture consists of a massive heart glowing to the  rhythm of a strong, deep and low frequency heartbeat sound which changes its  rate as visitors approach, move around and engage with it by playing various  percussion instruments and joining the base rhythm of the heartbeat. The  audience is invited to come together and creatively play, listen, dance and  feel the vibrations of the heart while enjoying the warm pulsating light.</p>

Desire Lines,Tatiana Trouve,2015-03-03,2015-08-30,Doris C. Freedman Plaza,"<p>For her  first public commission in the United States, Tatiana Trouv&eacute; has made a work  that responds to Central Park. She came to see the miles of pedestrian paths  that traverse its landscape as similar to the arteries of a living being.  There&rsquo;s no singular way to walk through the park, but rather a multitude of  possible routes that may be followed according to our own desires.</p>
<p>Drawing on  existing maps, Trouv&#233; isolated all of the marked pathways in the park and  estimated their distances. She identified 212, from secluded paths to prominent  thoroughfares, ranging in length from around 60 feet to four miles. Translating  her research into three-dimensional form, Trouv&#233; created three large-scale  storage racks that house a total of 212 spools. Each spool is wound with rope  equivalent in length to a corresponding pathway and labeled to identify its  location in the park.</p>
<p>Trouv&#233;&rsquo;s  work is also a reflection on the broader cultural significance of walking. It&rsquo;s  an activity that ranges from personal recreation to political statement, and  has inspired poets, musicians, writers, and artists. Thus, Trouv&#233; has  associated each pathway with a title drawn from culture and history that  relates to walking. In this way, <em>Desire  Lines</em> is both a systematic inventory of the park and an invitation to  explore the political and poetic resonance of the simple act of taking a walk.</p>

Toro,Allen Glatter,2015-04-17,2016-03-20,,"<p>&ldquo;At first  sight, the sculpture of Allen Glatter might appear to be a literal take on Paul  Klee&rsquo;s remark that a drawing is simply a line going on a walk. Each work,  including Toro, takes the form of a continuous curve zigzagging through space,  rising from the ground to above eye level and traversing the better part of a  gallery room, or in the case of the outdoor work, a sidewalk. Constructed from  seamlessly joined steel tubing, uniform in diameter, the freestanding  sculptures simultaneously gather and perforate the spaces around them. Walking  around the work produces a pleasant feeling that seems to derive from a rhythm  of anticipation and surprise; despite the few formal elements involved, the  overall experience varies radically from one vantage point to another. Each  sculpture has a definite axis, and when viewed in that direction, the piece  tends to open up into a number of loop windows. Though there are many changes  of direction in its path, the curve is less of a meandering walk than a sequence  of turns, an itinerary.&rdquo; </p>

Panorama,Various Artists,2015-04-23,2016-03-31,,"<p><em>Panorama</em> is an  open-air exhibition that takes inspiration from the High Line as an urban park  cutting straight through the city, creating new vistas and vantage points onto  the surrounding natural and man-made landscapes. The High Line is the ideal  stage for this series of sculptures and installations, all of which explore the  act of seeing and understanding the spectacle of nature. The exhibition  challenges historical notions of the sublime, quasi-religious experiences of  &ldquo;untouched&rdquo; nature, and the debate on the manicured versus the ostensibly  natural garden, opening up the possibility for experiencing nature in its  necessarily human-impacted state. *Olafur Eliasson&rsquo;s The Collectivity Project  will be on view from mid-May to mid-September 2015. </p>

Fat Boy,Leonard Ursachi,2015-05-01,2016-04-02,,"<p>The latest in Ursachi&rsquo;s decades-long &ldquo;bunker&rdquo; series, Fat  Boy is an oversized head embedded with three recessed bunker windows fitted  with mirrors instead of glass. Measuring 9.5 feet tall and 8.5 feet wide, the  artwork was carved from styrofoam and covered in a weatherproof, cementitious  material. Fat Boy is Ursachi&rsquo;s first bunker sculpture in the form of a head.  His previous bunkers, one of which was on view in at the entrance of Prospect  Park off Grand Army Plaza in 2007, have been cylindrical and made with a  variety of materials such as turkey feathers, willow branches, and ceramic  tiles. &ldquo;My bunkers reference not only war but also nests, shelter and refuge. They  are as much about longing for home as they are about conflict, &rdquo; states  Ursachi. </p>
<p>  Fat Boy is based on a classical Western putto, or male child  often depicted in Renaissance and Baroque artworks. &ldquo;Since antiquity,&rdquo; says the  artist, &ldquo;putti have been malleable signifiers, representing, among other  things, Eros, panic, abandon, and joy.&rdquo; Fat Boy&rsquo;s title derives not only from  his plump, cherubic face, but also from the WWII atomic bombs, Little Boy and  Fat Man, giving the sculpture twin references to Eros and war. </p>
<p>  Fat Boy was first exhibited at the John &amp; Mable Ringling  Museum of Art in Sarasota, Florida, which is a partial sponsor of this exhibit.  The exhibition is also in partnership with the <a href=""http://www.prospectpark.org/"">Prospect Park Alliance</a>. </p>",B,,,1
Blocks,Rashid Johnson,2015-05-01,2016-03-31,,"<p>Inspired by a childhood steeped in African American cultural  influences, Rashid Johnson creates layered artworks that engage a conversation  between personal biography and the implied gravitas of larger cultural and  historical narratives. Johnson works predominantly in mixed media sculptures  and paintings, combining bare materials such as mirror, wood, and shea butter  with loaded iconic objects including record covers, CB radios, historical  books, and common domestic objects. Throughout his career, Johnson has explored  the ways in which we form our sense of belonging to races and communities,  investigating the relationship between familiar objects and identity.</p>
<p>For his High Line Commission, Johnson built one of his minimalist  three-dimensional steel black grids, which houses a variety of objects  including busts painted to resemble shea butter (a material commonly used by  the artist), and acts as a living greenhouse as plants on the High Line begin  to intertwine with the sculpture over the year of its installation. Playing  with forms taken from the Minimalist tradition &ndash; Sol LeWitt&rsquo;s white open cubes  come to mind &ndash; Johnson turns them into a reflection on blackness by breaking  the rational structure open and embedding loaded objects within it.</p>
<p>Installed in an oblong island of plants growing between pathways on the  High Line just south of The Standard, High Line, the sculpture will change over  the course of its installation, the empty rectilinear vessel becoming a  horticultural container as the seasons pass. The work reflects the artist&rsquo;s  ongoing interest in a line from a book by Lawrence Weiner called &ldquo;Something to  Put Something On,&rdquo; in which the concept &ldquo;table&rdquo; is explained as &ldquo;something to put  something on.&rdquo; This semiotic explication resonates with Johnson, who pushes its  implications toward thinking about the ways in which lives, cultures, and  historical arcs are a mere practice of putting some things on top other things  that are imagined to be taken as given, such as the exemplary case of the  table.</p>

<p><em>Time after Time  Capsule</em> is a creation of Sebastian Masuda, a Japanese artist and an  instigator of Japan&rsquo;s craze over kawaii (cute) culture gone global. Masuda has  been behind the empowerment of cute girland youth-culture since 1995 through his  artful and colorful concept shop 6%DOKIDOKI in Tokyo&rsquo;s fashion destination  Harajuku. Masuda has made it his mission to encourage people to recall their  childlike sense of wonder by transmitting kawaii culture.</p>
<p><em>Time After Time  Capsule</em> is part of an ongoing, multi-city participatory project with like  capsules displayed last year in Miami, this year in New York and Amsterdam, and  future cities currently under consideration. In each location, the artist plans  a series of children and family workshops collaborating with the project&rsquo;s  community to create colorful objects using their personal items and cute  objects from 6%DOKIDOKI. The objects created by the participants will be  inserted into the capsule sculpture coloring the work as more items are added  throughout the duration of the installation.

Head of Goliath,Nicolas Holiber,2015-05-04,2015-10-08,,"<p>Inspiring artwork by the likes of Michelangelo, Caravaggio,  and Titian, the biblical story and long-standing art historical theme of David  and Goliath is not restricted to antiquity. The massive head is Nicolas  Holiber&rsquo;s modern take on the tale of the young shepherd David slaying the giant  Goliath with only a slingshot and stones. &ldquo;People come to New York to be the  underdog and beat whatever obstacle is in front of them,&rdquo; says Holiber. &ldquo;The  head of Goliath was David&rsquo;s trophy and I hope viewers will find inspiration in  this piece and think about what <em>Head of  Goliath</em>, as a symbol, means to them. For myself and many friends of mine,  New York is the Goliath,&rdquo; says the artist.</p>
<p>Combining reclaimed objects found within New York City&rsquo;s  debris and artistic materials, Holiber creates contemporary characters that are  inspired by the fragmented remains of ancient sculpture and the artwork from  past civilizations. &ldquo;I see the remnants of a classical bust or an Aztec stone  sculpture as testaments of the human spirit throughout time. Likewise,<em> Head of Goliath</em> will be a connection to  the past and serve as a symbol of the classic underdog tale that is shared by  so many in this amazing city,&rdquo; remarks Holiber.</p>
<p>Measuring over four feet tall by ten feet long, the sculpture  will be installed on its side in the center of Tribeca Park. &ldquo;Exhibiting  in the park presents a unique opportunity to observe how the outdoor  environment and NYC in particular will affect the sculpture.

DaSilva was influenced during her time as an intern with video and performance  artist Joan Jonas, as well as Richard Serra, whom she worked with for ten years  as a part time personal assistant in the 80s. Those experiences, along with the  birth of hip-hop and the fusion of graffiti with fine art, was extremely  influential in her art.  </p>

Four additional works dating from 2011 and 2012  will also be included in the exhibition. The sculptures range in height from  eight feet to 14 feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I first became interested in haiku poems because of the  simplicity of their structure,&rdquo; stated the artist. &ldquo;Three lines stacked  together containing 17 syllables. Five in the first line, seven in the middle,  and five in the third line. I thought of substituting shapes for the syllables  and instead of writing a poem with three sentences and 17 syllables, I made a  sculpture with three vertical sections and 17 shapes, five in the bottom  section, seven in the middle, and five in the top section. The three sections  are separated by horizontal, linear flat rectangles, my version of lined paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought that making a series of sculptures that shared a  common structural theme would unite them along their shared route on Broadway.  I also wanted to see how much variety I could create within a given set of  rules. Five sculptures are based on the haiku idea and the other four  sculptures have similar stacked elements, and I think they structurally relate  to the others.&rdquo;</p>

Borrowed Light,Sari Carel,2015-05-08,2015-10-05,,"<p><em>Borrowed Light</em> is an outdoor  sound installation and sculpture by artist Sari Carel in Sunset Park. The  project features abstract geometric architectural forms, incorporating field  recorded sounds from the park&rsquo;s local fauna. A series of related community  workshops and performances will accompany the project throughout the summer. </p>
<p>Sari Carel worked with Sunset Park&rsquo;s stewards to gather data on the  park&rsquo;s native species and created a richly layered soundscape for the  installation. The piece is played from speakers embedded in the sculpture, and  park visitors are invited to engage with both sound and sculpture.</p>
<p>Made out of several free-standing wood elements, this grouping draws on  a Modernist vocabulary, using forms that are anchored in a utilitarian past,  but also depart from that. The forms echo the grid lines of the city, and  create a drawing in space, conversing with the emblematic image of the  Manhattan skyline visible from the highest elevated locations of Sunset Park.</p>
<p><em>Borrowed Light</em> is part of  Carel&rsquo;s continued investigation into alternative relationships between sound,  image and audience. More importantly, Borrowed Light will give participants an  opportunity to form a personal experience with an art piece and get a palpable  sense of the creative process as both a private and public practice.

Fata Morgana,Teresita Fernandez,2015-06-01,2016-03-02,,"<p>Fata Morgana by New York-based  artist Teresita Fern&aacute;ndez, consists of 500 running feet of golden,  mirror-polished discs that create canopies above the pathways around the Park&rsquo;s  central Oval Lawn.</p>
<p>In nature, a Fata Morgana is a  horizontal mirage that forms across the horizon line. Alluding to this  phenomenon, Fernandez&rsquo;s project introduces a shimmering horizontal element to  the Park that engages visitors in a dynamic experience. The installation is a  mirror-polished, golden metal sculpture that hovers above the Park&rsquo;s winding  walkways to define a luminous experiential passage for Park visitors. The metal  forms, perforated with intricate patterns reminiscent of foliage, creates  abstract flickering effects as sunlight filters through the canopy, casting a  golden glow across the expanse of the work, paths, and passersby.&nbsp;The  project is Mad. Sq. Art&rsquo;s first to fully utilize the upper register of a  visitor&rsquo;s space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Fata Morgana</em> is a site-specific work  designed for, and inspired by, Madison Square Park,&rdquo; said Ms.  Fern&aacute;ndez.&nbsp;&ldquo;My concept was to invert the traditional notion of outdoor  sculpture by addressing all of the active walkways of the Park rather than  setting down a sculptural element in the Park&rsquo;s center. By hovering over the  Park in a horizontal band, <em>Fata Morgana</em> becomes a ghost-like,  sculptural, luminous mirage that both distorts the landscape and radiates  golden light.&rdquo;</p>

Long-Tailed Peacock and Short-Tailed Peacock,Gaston Lachaise,2015-05-07,2016-05-07,Bartow-Pell Mansion Museum,"<p>These  elegant and graceful peacocks designed in 1920 were intended for a formal  garden such as that on the grounds of the Bartow-Pell Mansion Museum. The  garden was conceived and constructed circa 1916 by the prominent architectural  firm of Delano &amp; Aldrich and recently restored in 2013. </p>
<p>Animals  were a theme to which Lachaise returned throughout his artistic career. He  sculpted peacocks, seagulls; swans, dolphins. The animals he chose to represent  were generally peaceful animals. The commissions for his animal works came  through his employer, the artist, Paul Manship (1885-1956) or architects with  whom he worked, including Welles Bosworth (1868-1966) and Philip Goodwin  (1885-1958). </p>
<p>In the case  of the short-tailed peacock, John Deering commissioned Lachaise in 1920 to make  two sculptural peacocks in stone to sit atop eight decorative spiral columns in  the Marine Garden of the home he was building outside of Miami, called Vizcaya.  Philip Goodwin commissioned the long-tailed peacock for a fountain on the wall  of his mansion on Long Island. In a poetic twist, Goodwin worked for Delano  &amp; Aldrich between 1914-1916.</p>

A Bench for the Night,Fanny Allie,2015-05-18,2016-05-01,"PS1 Greenstreet (Jackson Avenue and 46th Avenue), Queens","<p>Artist Fanny Alli&eacute; raises awareness about homelessness in her public art  installation <em>A Bench for the Night. </em>Her  wooden bench is shaped in the silhouette of a sleeping person, a reminder that  a public bench is a potential bed for some New Yorkers.&nbsp; She is interested in personifying the bench  while subtly referring to the dehumanization of people living on the streets.</p>
<p><em>A Bench for the Night</em> is a continuation of Alli&eacute;&rsquo;s focus on this  important social issue. In 2014 she took part in the Engaging Artists Residency  organized by the <a href=""http://avcenter.org/engaging-artists/"">Artist Volunteer Center</a> and <a href=""http://moreart.org/"">More Art</a>, which primarily focused on homelessness. <em>Engaging Artists</em><em>&nbsp;</em>encourages local artists to deepen  their understanding of socially engaged art through volunteer opportunities and  interactive workshops with professionals in the fields of fine art and  activism. During this six&ndash;week program, participants were required to volunteer  at least a half a day per week at a local charitable organization.</p>
<p>  In 2013, Alli&eacute; also exhibited the public artwork <em>Serendipity </em>in Tompkins Square Park. The sculpture was a life&ndash;size,  steel silhouette of a formerly homeless man who spent much of his time in the  park. Furthermore, <em>A Bench for the Night</em> is the continuation of her earlier neon sculpture <em>The Glowing Homeless</em> created in 2011 for <em>Bring to Light: Nuit Blanche New York </em>in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. <em>The Glowing Homeless</em> was a neon outline  of a human form that rested on a park bench. By rendering the homeless person  in neon light asleep amongst the park&rsquo;s crowds she created an alluring object  using an attractive material that reversed the normal reaction of avoidance and  instead drew people towards the form on the bench. Alli&eacute;&rsquo;s new A <em>Bench For the Night</em> will invite the  audience to sit on the bench, an interaction between the public and the artwork  that was not possible with <em>The Glowing  Homeless</em>.</p>
<p>  While A <em>Bench For a Night </em>primarily  alludes to homelessness, the piece also reflects one&rsquo;s desire to seek an  isolated place to rest and remove oneself from the continuous movement of the  city. When preparing for this exhibit, Alli&eacute; noticed a lack of seating in the  immediate vicinity. By placing the bench&ndash;sculpture in this small plaza, she has  created a new social space that simultaneously raises awareness on homelessness  among the general public, as well as artists and art&ndash;lovers visiting MoMA PS1 located  across the street. </p>",Q,40.745575,-73.946588,1
Please Touch the Art,Jeppe Hein,2015-05-17,2016-03-20,,"<p>Three bodies of work are represented in the exhibition by Danish artist Jeppe Hein. Appearing Rooms is a systematically changing installation with walls of water that create rooms which appear and disappear. Visitors may move from space to space as the jets of water rise and fall. Mirror Labyrinth NY is made with equidistantly spaced vertical planks of mirror-polished stainless steel. Arranged in three radial arcs, the alternating rhythm and uneven heights of the steel elements echo the Manhattan skyline. Connecting these two works and continuing along the length of the park, the artist has installed sixteen bright red Modified Social Benches. These witty sculptures reinvent the form of the park bench, turning it into a lyrical and evocative work of art. Like each of his installations, they generate spontaneous expression and social connection, giving us new perspectives on ourselves and the world we share.</p>

HeartSeat,Stereotank,2015-05-28,2015-11-15,,"<p><em>Heartseat</em> is a striking red  sculptural seat fabricated from a repurposed water tank.  This work was originally commissioned for the  juried Times Square Valentine Heart Design Competition. In its original  orientation, the work was a participatory installation in the form of a massive  heart glowing to the rhythm of a strong, deep and low frequency heartbeat sound  and visitors were encouraged to move around and engage with it by playing  various percussion instruments. Now, the once united heart is split in half in  order to form innovative public seating.  </p>
<p>Stereotank is founded by architects  Marcelo Ertorteguy and Sara Valente, and is dedicated towards creating a fusion  between architecture, music, design and environmental science with their public  art projects.</p>

A View from the Lunch Table: Students Bringing Issues to the Table,LeAp,2015-06-01,2015-09-13,Various Locations,"<p>Students  from ten New York City public middle schools, with two schools representing  each borough, have transformed school lunchroom tables into personalized  canvases and created colorful works of public art that touch upon critical  social issues in their community and across the globe. The tables, which have  been installed in ten community parks across the five boroughs, are a way of  giving young teens the chance to voice their opinions and reach out to the  public in hopes of inspiring social change through their art. This exhibition  was created by LeAp&rsquo;s Public Art Program in cooperation with NYC Parks and  marks the largest student exhibition in the history of NYC Parks and the first  to span five boroughs. The program has included visits with distinguished  artists such as Jenny Holzer, Crash, Kehinde Wiley, Emma Amos, Christo, and  Lorna Simpson among many others. For 34 years, LeAp (Learning through an  Expanded Art Program) has provided arts&ndash;based education to over two million  students K-12 throughout New York City.</p>
<p> Artworks  can be found through September in Seward Park and Morningside Park in  Manhattan, Fort Four Playground and Crotona Park in the Bronx, Washington Park  and Tiger Playground in Brooklyn, Juniper Valley Park, Forest Park (Dry Harbor  Playground), in Queens, and Silver Lake Park and Snug Harbor Cultural Center in  Staten Island.</p>

"All Consuming, Flow.15 Art and Music at Randall's Island",Nicholas Fraser,2015-05-01,2015-11-30,,"<p>Nicholas Fraser&rsquo;s <em>All Consuming </em>resembles  a typical city distance sign with two critical deviations; the names  represented on the sign are extinct cities and are constructed out of compacted  birdseed. The words are placed between metal grates and are intended to be  continually consumed by wildlife for the duration of the exhibition. As time  progresses the characters will become indefinable forms, similar to ruins of  cities uncovered by archaeologists. </p>
<p> Located on the southern shoreline of Randall&rsquo;s Island Park, the  sculpture is continually in flux, evoking the cyclical nature of cities by  harnessing natural processes to visually echo decay and ephemerality. Fraser  uses the names of cities from a wide range of cultures and draws attention to  the resilience of cultural heritage and its ability to survive through the  being adopted by direct descendants.</p>

Comprising five ten-foot-tall letters planted with succulent plants, this  living, vertical garden functions as the &ldquo;voice&rdquo; of the landscape, calling to  all who pass. Ma&rsquo;s goal is to invite photography with the piece, extending the  medium into a public space and a larger scale in order to record and share  visitor interaction. Ma&rsquo;s <em>hello</em> invokes familiar &ldquo;Greetings from ...&rdquo; postcards of a  previous era, and calls upon us to create and share our own digital messages  with Randall&rsquo;s Island Park as background.</p>

"Etherwave Architecture #1, Flow.15 Art and Music at Randall's Island",David Wilson,2015-05-01,2015-11-30,,"<p>David Wilson&rsquo;s <em>Etherwave Architecture #1</em> is inspired by the social,  political and spatial transformation of Randall&rsquo;s Island Park from &ldquo;dumping  ground&rdquo; for institutional uses into a lush park where citizens choose to spend  leisure time. The structure mimics objects and materials normally associated  with urban defensive architecture, such as wrought iron spiked guards and  fences, subverting their original meaning and context by directly and  specifically inviting interaction. </p>
<p> The iron and steel elements in <em>Etherwave Architecture #1</em> function as an engineered  Theremin, acting as antennas that control sound oscillators. The sizes and  shapes of the different elements allow approach from all around so that visitor  movement, exploration and interaction directly produces a range of sounds.  Through active engagement with these defensive structures, Wilson hopes to  bring awareness to the dilemmas surrounding public spaces, while playfully  appropriating objects that make up oppressive design practices.</p>

This female figure,  constructed of brightly painted wood, intends to invite visitors to sit and  gaze with her across the Harlem River. </p>
<p> She is surrounded by smaller structures that reflect buildings  containing her past, present and future life in <em>El Barrio</em>: her birthplace;  a caf&eacute; she owns and operates in the neighborhood; and the home of her dream  child of the future. A native of Japan, Takashima is inspired by the residents  and history of <em>El  Barrio</em>, and by the intersection of personal and political action.

"Who Owns the Sky&Alpha;, Flow.15 Art and Music at Randall's Island",Rob Swainston,2015-05-01,2015-11-30,,"<p>Installed along Randall&rsquo;s Island Park&rsquo;s southeastern shoreline, Rob  Swainston&rsquo;s <em>Who  Owns the Sky</em><em> is</em> a  large-scale semi-transparent billboard, hand-printed with images of clouds  inspired by historic woodcuts and engravings of sky motifs. The viewer can  observe their constantly shifting relation to cloud patterns both alongside the  frame and behind the translucent fabric. These shifts, according to the artist,  evoke and recreate the human quest for direction and meaning in the heavens.</p>
<p>  Ownership of the heavens was left to the gods, as depicted in myths,  described through religions, and displayed in art. However, with the advent of  aerospace technology, constellations have ceded their dominion to planes,  no-fly zones and drones. Globalization and global climate change further  complicate this story. <em>Who Owns the Sky&Alpha;</em> questions our attempt to assert power over  a firmament in which our presence remains transient.</p>

Oh Sit! 14 Sculptors Consider the Chair,14 Sculptors,2015-06-06,2015-11-08,,"<p>Located along  the esplanade leading up to the recently opened High Bridge, <em>Oh Sit! 14 Sculptors Consider the Chair</em> is a group exhibition of nine artists&rsquo; public artworks. In a frantic world,  finding a chair can be almost impossible and settling comfortably into one can  be an enormous satisfaction. Sitting in the wrong seat can cause anxiety and an  even pain. Exhibiting artists Dan Bergman, Allan Cyprys, Robert Dell, Gregoire  Ferland, Esther Grillo, Christina Jorge, Siena Gillann Porta, Herb Rosenberg  and Chuck von Schmidt respond imaginatively to the notion of sitting or using a  chair. <em>Oh Sit!</em> is framed as an  imperative, a command&mdash;a way of asking the viewer to look and really consider  the concept &ldquo;chair&rdquo; both objectively and subjectively.  </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.14sculptors.com/"">14 Sculptors</a> is a group of professional  artists who have been actively exhibiting throughout the metropolitan area,  creating a forum for experimental sculpture and principally installation  artworks free from the constraints of a commercial viewpoint.

Calatrava on Park Avenue,Santiago Calatrava,2015-06-08,2015-11-01,,"<p>Seven monumental sculptures represent the  artist&rsquo;s continued exploration of expressive forms and structure abstracted  from nature. In the artist&rsquo;s own words, &ldquo;their relation to the natural world  suggests a link between man and nature, implying the sculptures are found  objects in a human forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santiago Calatrava&rsquo;s work continues to shape and  redefine the boundaries that have historically separated the visual arts, particularly  sculpture, from architecture and engineering. Two of the new works, <em>S2</em> and <em>S3</em>, are complex tension compression structures wherein each element  is held in place through the utilization of very fine, almost invisible  cables.&nbsp; Calatrava&rsquo;s intention is for the sculptures to &ldquo;simply grow from  the ground. Within each sculpture, an internal logic of autonomy delivers  lyrical forms and implies a sense of elevation and spiritual uplifting.&rdquo;  Santiago Calatrava builds basswood models to evaluate the aesthetic and  structural characteristics of each work before moving to full-scale metal sculptures.&nbsp;  The largest of these,<em> S1</em>, is 40&rsquo; across and approximately 20&rsquo; tall. From  the side, its rib-like structure appears as a thin arched line. When  approached, the massive layered roof reveals its architectonic depth. As a  whole, these works express a unified aesthetic anchored in the artist&rsquo;s  continuing exploration of the relationship between the origins of creativity  and the evolutionary structure of the natural world.</p>

"Oracle of the Past, Present and Future",Jorge Luis Rodriguez,2015-06-06,2016-05-01,,"<p><em>The Oracle of the Past, Present and  Future </em> is a 12-foot-tall structure that consists of  geometric interlocking parts with elements of steel, wood, glass, and a  magnificent dome that adds to its mystical symbolism. The work is inspired by  the study of celestial bodies: the influence of the sun, moon, planets and  zodiac constellations on human affairs and the natural world. Rodriguez invites  the public to consider the mysteries of astrology and engage in contemplation  and inner reflection while walking through the sculpture. The sculpture is  located on the lawn just inside Tompkins Square Park at St. Mark&rsquo;s Place and  Avenue A.</p>
<p>In  addition to the installation at Tompkins Square, four sculptures will accompany  his permanent sculpture <em>Growth</em> at the  East Harlem Art Park at 120th Street and Sylvan Place. &quot;I have tried to  capture the interaction between trees, birds, insects, flowers, and man. My  sculpture may portray a seed sprouting from the ground, an insect transforming  into a flower, or a bird changing into a tree. I hope to create an art piece  that will serve as a source of enjoyment and inspiration to the community,&rdquo;  stated Rodr&iacute;guez about <em>Growth</em> in 1985.

Though feathers appear fragile and weightless, sculpture was  fabricated with stained and sealed birch plywood and stands at 12 feet  tall.&Atilde;&Alpha;&Acirc;  He notes that a feather is the  symbolic remains of a journey or flight. Bird migration gracefully parallels  the journey taken by people around the world. The diversity of New York City  makes it an interesting and fertile arena for this homage to cultural diversity  and migration. He also hopes that the sculpture will draw people from other  neighborhoods to the park, adding an additional layer of movement. </p>
<p>The Riverside Park Bird Sanctuary runs from 116th Street to  124th Street. Since 1997, the approximately 10 acres of the Sanctuary have been  undergoing reforestation, and over 3,000 plants have been added. In the last  thirty years 177 species of birds have been seen in or around the Sanctuary,  with a yearly average of about 120 species. Visitors can expect to see the blue  grosbeak, summer tanager, hooded warbler, mourning warbler and nine species of  sparrows, among others.

Suspect Terrain,Heide Fanacht,2015-05-17,2015-08-30,,"<p>Through her latest public artwork, titled <em>Suspect Terrain</em>, Heide Fasnacht  details the creation and aftermath of a sinkhole. In Fasnacht&rsquo;s vision, the  particularities of fragmentation span 50-feet above ground and are detailed in  painted plywood &ndash; a stand-in for the cement, asphalt, and rock substrate that  the sculpture maps. Fasnacht&rsquo;s surface was inspired by striking media coverage  and documentation of massive sinkholes. By sculpturally depicting these  devastating geological occurrences, Fasnacht turns the relationship between  event and documentation into a personal and precarious action.</p>
<p> At Socrates Sculpture Park, the artist extends beyond the  sinkhole&rsquo;s composition to question assumptions about the built environment,  including the park itself. At the bottom of <em>Suspect Terrain</em> lies a house half-submerged in a pool of  illusionistic water, an allegory using the language of geological events that  simultaneously explores the park&rsquo;s unique history as an illegal dumpsite and  landfill.</p>

At least  twice annually (spring and fall), Socrates installs a new work on the 11&quot;x 28&quot;billboard, which can be seen nearly a mile away on Broadway in Long Island City.</p>
<p>Internationally acclaimed photographer Vera Lutter creates ghostly  images of subjects as varied as urban centers, abandoned factories, ancient  monuments, and natural forests. Like much of her work, <em>Degas Horses</em> was taken using a &ldquo;camera obscura&rdquo; &ndash; a centuries-old  optical device that uses light entering through a small hole into a darkened  chamber to slowly capture an image of its subject.</p>

Two Trees in Balance,Gabriela Albergaria,2015-05-17,2015-08-30,,"<p>Gabriela Albergaria has erected a 10-foot concrete wall  adorned with two suspended trees for her piece <em>Two Trees in Balance</em> at Socrates Sculpture Park. Albergaria is  interested in examining and deconstructing the cultural and social beliefs  surrounding images of the natural. </p>
<p>As part of her installation Albergaria has meticulously  reconstructed dozens of branches and tree stumps salvaged from across New York  City into two new trees, which she suspends diagonally off of the ground from a  steel cable. Each tree hovers in-between the wall and the earth, poised in a  precarious state by their own equal weight. Visually the piece implies  suspended movement &ndash; simultaneous growth and decay &ndash; and the effort required to  maintain that balance. With <em>Two Trees in Balance</em>, the artist manipulates  preconceived expectations of what the natural should look like, as well as the  fictional beliefs that we use to conjure the natural world.</p>

Assembled into their domes, two properties emerge: sound reflected as  echo, and movement of the panels from humidity and weather. As the wood&rsquo;s fibers  absorb and lose moisture over different weather conditions, the bent panels are  predefined to close and open in their particular directions.</p>

He created these works shortly after <em>Growth </em>with scrap metal from the  metal shop where his permanent work was fabricated. They equally represent Rodr&iacute;guez&rsquo;s interest in nature and the cultural  exchange derived from travel to different countries. They are fabricated in  painted welded steel, one of his favored techniques, and stand between seven  and nine feet tall. </p>

caesura: a forum,"Jessica Feldman, Jerome W Haferd & K Brandt Knapp",2015-06-20,2016-04-15,,"<p>Located on the Acropolis of Marcus Garvey Park, <em>caesura: a forum</em>  by artist  Jessica Feldman and architects Jerome W Haferd &amp; K Brandt Knapp is inspired  by the park&rsquo;s iconic antebellum Mount Morris Fire Watchtower, and by Harlem&rsquo;s  vibrant tradition of activism and rallies. The bell is silent now, as the tower  was temporarily dismantled in 2015 as the first phase for its reconstruction.  Simultaneously, Harlem is undergoing dynamic change and New York City is  experiencing a resurgence of public culture. caesura seeks to temporarily fill  an architectural gap &ndash; and create a social space &ndash; by echoing and inverting the  form and function of the absent tower. Like the bell, caesura aims to call up  the neighborhood, to preserve and revitalize Harlem&rsquo;s histories, and to connect  newer and older community members to each other, by reactivating this site for  congregation, viewing, and listening. The installation will reframe history  with a temporary structure and sound. A &ldquo;caesura&rdquo; is a break or pause, a place  to catch your breath, most specifically in ancient spoken-word art. </p>
<p>The architectural component of this piece begins at the Acropolis  ground as an open-air, steel frame that supports a &ldquo;horizontal tower&rdquo;, which  the viewer can pass through and meander under. In the center of the piece, a  flattened &ldquo;bell&rdquo; made of reflective steel. </p>
<p>The sonic component of the piece consists of Feldman&rsquo;s interactive  composition, made up of bell sounds and voices. Historical and contemporary  recordings and live-streaming voices from speeches, rallies, chants, and  assemblies in Harlem are alternated with a through-composed layer of echoing  bells. Analogous to a megaphone, the formal profile of the tower has been  tipped sideways, allowing sound to be projected outward. Taut, translucent film  runs through this shape and is mounted with electromagnetic transducers that  turn the material into a speaker, allowing sound to pour down from the spaces  in between the arches above visitors. A microphone mounted at the entrance to  the installation allows visitors to broadcast their own voices through the  piece. Those not present can participate through an interactive online  component, allowing them to trigger the bell and contribute their own live  audio to the arches. New and old histories are recorded, spliced, and digitally  scripted together, activating the acropolis throughout the day.</p>

Studio in the Park: The Queens Museum-ArtBuilt Mobile Studio Residency Program,,2015-06-15,2015-08-16,,"<p><em>Studio in the Park:  The Queens Museum-ArtBuilt Mobile Studio Residency Program</em> hosts two  residencies that provide visual artists the chance to work in a purpose-built  mobile studio space situated adjacent to the Museum in Flushing Meadows-Corona  Park.</p>
<p>  The first residency, running from June 15 through July 15,  has been awarded to The People&rsquo;s Design Laboratory (PDL), a project by Patrick  Rowe, in collaboration with Mobile Print Power.   The project will function as a research center for the development of  unique navigational park signage, a pressing challenge for the park, using collaborative  and participatory design strategies. The signage concepts developed at the PDL  will capture the spirit of the park and will be created by the park community  through a series of participatory events and open studio hours.  The signs will highlight the unique  vernacular aesthetics that thrive in a place as culturally diverse as  Queens.</p>
<p>The second residency, going from July 16 through August 16,  has been awarded to <em>A Collection of Walks</em>,  a project by Matthew Jensen.  The project  will incubate a new body of work that brings Jensen&rsquo;s process of walking,  collecting, and documenting to explore the landscapes and neighborhoods in and  around Flushing Meadows Corona Park.  New  York City parks have been a source of inspiration for Jensen over the past ten  years. Here in Queens, Jensen&rsquo;s walks through Flushing Meadows Corona Park will  yield a collection of objects, ephemera and natural detritus that will be  carefully arranged inside the mobile studio as a cabinet of curiosities, where  park-goers will be invited to experience the varied collections culled from  local landscapes. In the weeks following the residency Jensen will create a map  or &ldquo;walker&rsquo;s guide&rdquo; that the public can use as inspiration and guidance for  reexamining their neighborhood and seeing the familiar in a new light.</p>
<p>Additional information, including specific dates for project  events and open studio hours for A Collection of Walks, will be posted on the <a href=""http://www.queensmuseum.org/2015/06/the-queens-museum-artbuilt-mobile-studio-residency-program"">Queens  Museum&rsquo;s</a> website and social media channels.</p>

"Water, Gift of life",The Art Students League of New York,2015-06-11,2016-06-10,,"<p>The Art Students League of New York, one of America&rsquo;s premier art schools, presents the Model to Monument Program (M2M), a collaboration with NYC Parks  that has culminated in the installation the sculpture, <em>Water, Gift of Life</em>, at Van Cortlandt Park. </p>
<p>In response  to this year&rsquo;s theme of Patterns in Nature, the artists created a sinuous steel  twisted sculpture. The fluke of a tail runs down like a rolling wave and  culminates to form the head of a water drop. The downward flow of the fish-wave  form echoes the landscape of the hill of the Van Cortlandt House Museum, which  drops quickly down a Southward hill, and the south-running Tibbett&rsquo;s Brook  through Van Cortlandt Park down to the City.</p>
<p>The shiny stainless-steel  sculpture reflects the park in a similar way that water&rsquo;s surface reflects the  surrounding trees. Additionally the sculpture is a nod to the water sources  that surrounds the piece&ndash;the Nature Center to the North which provides an  exploratory, scientific perspective of the parks ecosystems. To the West, the Pool is run with engineered water systems. By contrast, Van Cortland Lake is located to the east and wetlands to the south. </p>
<p>This collaborative installation was created by artists Lee Apt, Caroline Bergonzi, Kate Jansyn, Sukyung Kim, Donat King, Paola Morales, and Ken Shih.  The group also has works concurrently on view in Riverside South Park in Manhattan. </p>

Image Objects,Various Artists,2015-06-30,2015-11-20,,"<p>Our daily experience of urban space is technologically  mediated &ndash; from the images on screens in taxis, subway stations and streets, to  the maps, cameras, and social networks of our smart phones. We use these  devices to navigate, document, and share our lives online. In so doing, we  participate in the creation of a rapidly changing digital landscape. Responding  to this contemporary context, Image Objects brings together the work of seven  international artists who share an interest in digital culture and its  influence on the relationship between images and objects.</p>
<p>With new works produced specifically for this exhibition,  each artist has drawn from source images and used digital means to create new  sculptural forms. Alice Channer&rsquo;s R O C K F A L L (2015) and Jon Rafman&rsquo;s New  Age Demanded (2015) employ advanced digital fabrication tools to transform  images into three-dimensional objects. Other artists &ndash; like Amanda Ross-Ho and  Artie Vierkant &ndash; have created works that directly address the photographic life  of a sculpture when it is documented and shared online. As images are rendered  into objects and objects are circulated as images, the boundaries between the  physical and the virtual are blurred, challenging us to rethink how we see the  world around us.</p>

This spring,  conversations and meetings with local community organizations revealed a shared  interest in creating an outdoor learning and gathering space near the water&rsquo;s  edge. Workshops at the Pier with Henry Street Settlement&rsquo;s GED Class at the  Boys and Girls Republic explored specific uses and how the sun, sound, wind and  views can play a part in the design.</p>
<p>Incorporating shade and  seating, the space is a great place to read a book or enjoy the sound of the  water, and will also be used for classes workshops, poetry rehearsals and more.

Whattoseesottahw,Eirini Linardaki,2015-08-15,2016-07-07,,"<p>Eirini  Linardaki&rsquo;s public art installation <em>Whattoseesottahw </em>is inspired by children&rsquo;s drawings created during artist-led workshops in  the park. Her work often concentrates on creating beautiful, unexpected moments  within urban and abandoned spaces. As a resident of the East Village, she  continues this exploration inher  installation <em>Whattoseesottahw</em>, where  sheembraces the often ambiguous  nature of children&rsquo;s drawings. In her workshops, children and families visiting  Tompkins Square were encouraged to create images of familiar wildlife that they  encountered in the park. These drawings and paintings may appear indecipherable  at a first glance, similar to a Rorschach test; however, when children are  asked to elaborate they create joyful stories about the natural elements they  observed. </p>
<p>Several  of these drawings were collected and combined to create images that were  transferred onto wood panels. The images were then either cut out of the panel,  revealing glances of the park, or partially removed with half of the drawing  still visible. Some of the cutouts were painted with chalk paint so kids can  complete the drawing. The panels, located in the Slocum Memorial Fountain  Plaza, are low on the fence in order to maintain a relationship with children&rsquo;s  eye level. Linardaki will periodically conduct workshops throughout the  exhibition in the sitting area behind the park house.  </p>

Above the Line,Kerry James Marshall,2015-06-01,2016-03-31,,"<p>Through compelling portraiture and  both intimate and disquieting scenes of domestic life, Kerry James Marshall  comments on contemporary and art historical depictions of black identity. Born  in Birmingham, Alabama, raised in South Central Los Angeles in the 1970s, and  currently based in Chicago, Marshall is acutely sensitive to his own social  responsibility as an artist. The artist plunges his work into an exploration of  race-consciousness, painting &ldquo;unequivocally, emphatically black figures,&rdquo;  through whose depiction he articulates his intention to &ldquo;reclaim the image of  blackness as an emblem of power.&rdquo; Marshall has been commissioned to complete  numerous permanent public works at locations including the Legler Branch  Library in Chicago, The Print Center in Philadelphia, and the San Francisco  Museum of Modern Art&rsquo;s Haas Atrium.</p>
<p>For the High Line, Marshall presents  a large-scale, hand-painted mural adapted specifically for the High Line.  Titled <em>Above the Line</em>, the mural is an extension of the artist&rsquo;s <em>Dailies</em> series, specifically the cartoon strip &ldquo;Rhythm Mastr,&rdquo; an epic narrative of the  struggle between tradition and modernity within the Afro-diasporic worldview.  The works address the lack of black superheroes found in American comics, and  raise historical and philosophical questions in black vernacular English. This  particular comic painting, <em>Above the Line</em>, imagines the redevelopment of  rooftop water tanks as luxury homes and condominiums.</p>

Against the Run,Alicja Kwade,2015-09-10,2016-02-22,Doris C. Freedman Plaza,"<p>Nature provided us with a general  way to measure time: dividing it into days, lunar months, and seasons. Since  ancient times, however, we have invented ways of measuring time in smaller  units with ever&ndash;increasing precision &mdash; from the sundial to the hourglass to the  atomic clock. As clock making technology advanced during the Renaissance,  handsome public clocks became a source of civic pride, as well as a useful  amenity. In today&rsquo;s digital age, they more often evoke a sense of nostalgia for  another era.</p>
<p> In <em>Against the Run</em>, Alicja Kwade (b. 1979, Katowice, Poland) has created  a clock that tells the correct time, but does so in a way that confounds expectations.  Adapting a nineteenth&ndash;century design that we might typically see in New York  City, the artist has reversed the conventional mechanism. The face of the clock  rotates backwards while the second hand appears to stand still, pointing  vertically at all times. Our understanding of how a clock should run is second  nature, making this variation almost impossible to read, even as it continues  to tell the right time. Kwade&rsquo;s whimsical clock captures her interest in the  systems we invent to make sense of our lives and the world. In doing so, it  prompts us to see &ldquo;reality&rdquo; from a new perspective. </p>

THE MOMENT,Various Artists,2015-09-27,2016-02-29,,"<p>To draw a Contemporary Art forum is to separate from both modern and historical perspectives, to immerse oneself in current time and space. A meeting point in the processing time from past and to the future. We might call it the &ldquo;moment;&rdquo; it is short and creative. It entails catching an idea when it appears like a flash of light. It can &mdash; and must &mdash; disappear in the next femtosecond. A &ldquo;moment&rdquo; can mean a minute portion of time, or the product of quantity (as a force) and the distance to a particular point. THE MOMENT in contemporary art can be ideally a philosophical term and scientific necessity.</p>
<p>In 2015, the Taiwanese American Arts Council takes THE MOMENT as a theme, and develops it to a series of multi&ndash;disciplinary programs taking place in various venues. The traditional format of painting shares space with the latest interactive technology. These are threads expressing multiple directions, meeting in this MOMENT. The MOMENT investigates the play of the virtual and the real, inward and outward, our intimate reflection on a surface, dark and light, or a view of self in the outside environment. The Moment visualizes a picture, an object, a location, a person, or a fanciful collective memory of how we evolved as creatures. We are about to investigates the artist&rsquo;s relation to society and himself.</p>

My Circle,Beverly Pepper,2015-10-23,2016-05-31,,"<p>In special recognition of Beverly Pepper&rsquo;s 93rd birthday, the  monumental sculpture <em>My Circle, 2008</em> is on view in Union Square. The sculpture continues the artist&rsquo;s contemplation  of time, materiality and place, and is part of <em>Curvae</em>, her series of curved forms. By using Cor&ndash;Ten steel, a  corrosion&ndash;resistant material that naturally and quickly develops a  weathered&ndash;looking patina, Pepper is able to speed up the oxidation process, and  in so doing suggest the concept of elapsed time through the sculpture&rsquo;s skin of  rust.</p>
<p>Like many of her monumental works, <em>My  Circle</em> engages the viewer through the interplay of convex and concave  forms. The use of opposing forces &ndash; vertical and horizontal, interior and  exterior &ndash; creates a lyrical meditation of space that is at once dominant and  intimate. The artist has stated that &ldquo;Seeing, touching, and the physical  sensory engagement is the way into my sculpture; my intention is that the  meaning of my work rests in experiencing it, similar to the performing arts  where listening and seeing the moments of a performance where meaning is  revealed through experience.&rdquo; She notes that <em>My Circle</em>, standing at fourteen feet tall in Cor&ndash;Ten steel, for her  recalls an image from years ago relating to the symbolic character in Zen  Buddhism where it is known as the Enso, a drawing in ink of an open or closed  circle. The closed circle represents the totality of experience and life. The  open circle represents the imperfection found in all things, and is known as  the circle of enlightenment, its symbolism referring to the beginning and end  of all things, the circle of life, and the connectedness of existence. What  Pepper is drawn to within this narrative is the notion of the &ldquo;connectedness of  existence&rdquo; and how we can connect people and populations through art.</p>

While many species have been devastated, some are adapting and thriving on the largesse of urban life. Hawks dive from high rise cornices to feast on the rich urban population of pigeons and rats; bears walk through New Jersey neighborhoods; and just several blocks from Court Square Park, a coyote found its way to a rooftop in Long Island City.  </p>

The Dance,DB Lampman,2015-11-09,2016-10-28,,"<p><em>The Dance</em> consists of five figures floating 15 feet above the ground. The figures, formed with steel and wrapped in nylon, hold hands and dance whimsically within a rectangular steel structure.&nbsp; At night the figures light up and cast a glow around the neighboring trees. <em>The Dance</em> is inspired by Henri Matisse&rsquo;s painting by the same name. Similar interlocked figures can be found throughout art history, including Mayan art, African tribal sculptures, and ancient Mesopotamia, among others, to symbolize family, community, and spiritual or universal connectivity. Lampman uses this symbol for the coming together of the Staten Island community.</p>
<p>Lampman lives and works in Staten Island and has embraced the diverse community made up of residents from around the world. In the exhibition, the five figures are entwined in a dance&mdash;they could be Flamenco dancers from Mexico, Kandyan dancers from Sri Lanka, or&nbsp; a dance from West Africa such as the Yankadi, or the Makru. </p>
<p>Many Staten Island neighborhoods were flooded during Hurricane Sandy, and sadly lives and homes were lost in the storm.&nbsp; However, Staten Island came together during this crisis&mdash;strangers dropped everything and join people from around the island and all over the world to rebuild the community. &nbsp;The neighborhoods&rsquo; joint effort is an integral part of the inspiration for Lampman&rsquo;s public artwork.&nbsp; Additionally, Lampman hopes that the installation will inspire additional community development, as the informal pavilion can be used for public dance and music performances by community members. </p>",R,40.499764,-74.251476,1

<p>  St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day marks the celebration of the life of the  patron saint of Ireland and is observed by people of Irish descent around the  world. But, as Riley states, &ldquo;the tradition of the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day Parade is  entirely American.&rdquo; The first parade in honor of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day was  organized by Irishmen serving in the British army stationed in Boston,  Massachusetts in 1737. It began as nothing more than drunken revelry, singing,  and a shared sense of homesickness. 200 years later the tradition was adopted  in Ireland and today there are St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day parades in 15 nations across  six continents.</p>
<p>  During a 2007 visit to Havana, Riley discovered that his  Irish roots had Cuban connections. In fact, one of of the city&rsquo;s main streets  is called Calle O&rsquo;Reilly, named for Alejandro O&rsquo;Reilly, an Irishman and early  abolitionist who served as a general in the Spanish army in 18th&ndash;century Cuba  and later served as governor of Spanish&ndash;occupied Louisiana. Like O&rsquo;Reilly, many  Irish settled in Cuba in the 18th and 19th centuries, leaving a legacy of  prominent historical figures of Irish&ndash;Cuban descent and there are still a great  number of current day Cuban residents with Irish heritage.</p>
<p>  With this history in mind, Duke Riley returned to Cuba in  2009 to stage the first St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day Parade in Havana, a performance for  &lsquo;Chelsea Visits Havana&rsquo; at Museum Nacional de Bellas Artes as part of the  Havana Biennial. The Broadway Billboard on view at Socrates Sculpture Park  consists of a section of a larger drawing the artist did as a record of his  2009 performance, along with representations of iconic American cartoon  characters marching through the streets of Havana.</p>
<p>  Like the first parades in America, Riley&rsquo;s St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day  performance reminded participants of the positive potentials of social  inclusion and cultural exchange from the earliest parades and commemorations.  Riley&rsquo;s 2009 parade displayed a romanticized vision of a distant land &ndash;  Ireland, Cuba, and America &ndash; separated by the sea. With today&rsquo;s warming of  relations between historically cool American and Cuban governments, El Primero  Desfile de San Patricio en la Habana, Cuba presciently experiments with the  merging of the two cultures.</p>

OY/YO,Deborah Kass,2015-11-11,2016-08-31,,"<p>Walking the line between respectful homage and brazen appropriation, Brooklyn-based artist Deborah Kass mimics and reworks the signature styles of iconic 20th century male artists &mdash;including Frank Stella, Andy Warhol, Jackson Pollock, Ed Ruscha, and Robert Indiana &ndash; often with a feminist twist. OY/YO is sourced from urban and Brooklyn slang, the statement &ldquo;I am&rdquo; in Spanish, and the popular Yiddish expression, as a riff on Ruscha&rsquo;s iconic word paintings. </p>
<p>OY/YO has been a significant and reoccurring motif in Kass&rsquo; work since its first appearance in 2011, taking form in paintings, prints, and tabletop sculptures. Set alongside the iconic bridges of Brooklyn&rsquo;s waterfront and visible to viewers from Manhattan, Brooklyn Bridge Park&rsquo;s Main Street lawn is an apt location for a monumental installation of OY/YO. Similar to the City of New York&rsquo;s &ldquo;Leaving Brooklyn: Oy Vey!&rdquo; sign at the Williamsburg Bridge and the &ldquo;Leaving Brooklyn: Fuhgeddaboudit&rdquo; sign on the BQE, OY/YO references Brooklyn&rsquo;s ethnic communities with whimsy and warmth. </p>
<p>Commissioned by Two Trees and presented in partnership with Brooklyn Bridge Park, the work will be on view through August 2016 and is presented on the occasion of the artist&rsquo;s exhibition No Kidding opening at Paul Kasmin Gallery in Chelsea December 9, 2015.

Two Orchids,Isa Genzken,2016-03-01,2016-08-21,Doris C. Freedman Plaza,"<p>Once a rare and exotic flower, the orchid has become one of the world&rsquo;s most ubiquitous indoor plants. From corporate offices to domestic interiors, from upscale florists to Home Depot, this tropical plant can now be seen anywhere&ndash;and acquired by anybody. It&rsquo;s a striking and decorative flower without any dominant symbolism, except perhaps a hint of luxury left over from the 19th century when orchids were seen as &ldquo;the chosen ornaments of royalty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For eminent German artist Isa Genzken, the mass-produced white orchid has become the quintessential flower of our age: global, accessible, and open to interpretation. Rising to 28 and 34 feet respectively, the paired stems of Genzken&rsquo;s towering sculpture wind elegantly skyward, capturing light and casting shadows in a play of rhyming forms. Two Orchids heralds the entrance to Central Park in voluptuous full flower, its pristine white petals free from any blemishes. It stands as an idealized, colossal version of the familiar plant: a civic monument to the perfect orchid, now the chosen ornament of contemporary culture. </p>

Untitled (Blind Idealism Is...),Barbara Kruger,2016-03-21,2017-03-31,,"<p>Barbara Kruger is an American artist  who works with pictures and words. Kruger uses the fluency she developed as a  graphic designer for publications such <em>Mademoiselle</em>, <em>House &amp;  Garden</em>, and <em>Aperture</em>, to inform her work as an artist, insistently  addressing the issues of power, property, money, race, and sexuality. Over the  past three decades her work has ranged from the photographic merging of image  and text, to immersive video installations, to room-wrapping textual  exhibitions, to large-scale outdoor displays of words and images. Two of her  best-known works &ndash; Your body is a battleground and I shop therefore I am &ndash; also  showcase the feminist overtones of her artworks, and her concentration on women  as a lucrative site for advertising and consumerism.</p><p>
  For the High Line, Kruger presents <em>Untitled  (Blind Idealism Is&hellip;)</em>, a new work realized as a hand-painted mural.  Continuing her unabashed criticism of culture and power, the mural features the  slogan &ldquo;BLIND IDEALISM IS <span style=""text-decoration:line-through"">REACTIONARY</span> <span style=""text-decoration:line-through"">SCARY</span> DEADLY,&rdquo; an  adaptation of a quote from Afro-Caribbean philosopher and revolutionary thinker  Frantz Fanon, which has appeared in multiple works by the artist. The original  statement by Fanon, &ldquo;Blind idealism is reactionary,&rdquo; suggests that political  and religious convictions stem from the situations from which they grow, not  from the inherent nature of individual human beings. According to Kruger, the  work reflects &ldquo;how we are to one another&rdquo; within &ldquo;the days and nights that  construct us.&rdquo; These texts, along with Kruger&rsquo;s own writings, resonate with  particular potency in today&rsquo;s political climate.</p>",M,40.747311,-74.0052,1
DNA Totem,Suprina Kenney,2016-03-28,2016-09-30,,"<p>The <em>DNA Totem</em> is a 10&rsquo; tall spiral in the shape of a DNA  helix that is embedded with detritus and discarded items donated by community  residents as well as found objects from the artist. The looming structure  serves as an historical reference to human evolution and the footprint humans  leave behind. The <em>DNA Totem</em> will be on view on the southern overlook terrace  near the Fifth Avenue and 120th Street entrance to Marcus Garvey Park, a historic Harlem park located  at the intersection of East and Central Harlem just 10 blocks north of Museum  Mile.</p>
<p>According  to the artist, &ldquo;The <em>DNA Totem</em> is  meant to bring up for discussion the seemingly unconscious disregard for how we  affect our planet.  I do this by showing  a very small sampling of unwanted objects on the iconic, universal structure  that is life itself; the DNA strand. Even though this symbol represents all  living things, we have forced our compulsion for &lsquo;the next best thing&rsquo; onto all  others we share this planet with, usually with bad result. Using visual mapping  I celebrate us, and our absurdity. We are beautiful, horrid, tragic, and  profoundly funny.&rdquo;</p>

Chirality is defined  by a three dimensional entity that has no internal plane of symmetry along the  x, y or z-axis. </p>
<p>Briggs states that her work &ldquo;grows out of mathematics and architecture  &ndash; geometry, symmetry and rhythm &ndash; line, plane and volume &ndash; visual perception  and spatial understanding. They are three-dimensional patterns that are at once  familiar and foreign.

Smart Tree,Nari Ward,2016-04-01,2017-03-31,,"<p>Inspired by a building adjacent to the High Line that had  been transformed into an indoor parking lot, Nari Ward reconfigures a memory  from his childhood for his High Line Commission,&nbsp;<em>Smart Tree</em>. Returning to his father&rsquo;s home in Jamaica after fifteen  years away, Ward remembers finding one of two abandoned cars in the front yard  sprouting a lime tree. He reimagines this fantastical story for the High Line  in the form of a Smart car refinished with strips of tire treads and propped up  on cinder blocks. In place of a lime tree,&nbsp;<em>Smart Tree</em>&nbsp;will feature an apple tree growing out of its roof,  adapted out of necessity for its North American context. With the car&rsquo;s  cinderblock base representing stasis, and its coating of tire treads suggesting  perpetual movement, Ward&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Smart  Tree</em>&nbsp;holds up a mirror to the flux surrounding the High Line itself  and reminds viewers of the High Line&rsquo;s history as a major transportation artery  in Manhattan.</p>

Sunbathers I & II,Kathryn Andrews,2016-05-01,2017-03-31,,"<p>For the High Line, Kathryn Andrews presents her first public  art commission, responding to two contrasting aspects of the elevated park: its  relationship to nearby billboards and to the natural landscape. Andrews  describes the High Line&rsquo;s environment as a &ldquo;hyper-surreal image world,&rdquo;  composed of large-scale advertisements and commercial signs that surround park  visitors as they stroll high above the bustling cityscape. Andrews notes, by  contrast, that the High Line&rsquo;s physical design offers visitors a chance to  develop awareness of the body in relation to extreme natural weather conditions  including intense winds, rain, snow, and sun.</p>
<p>Andrews&rsquo;s first sculpture,&nbsp;<em>Sunbathers I</em>, is a towering box-like structure, silkscreened with a  black-and-white stock image of a public beach sign that announces, &ldquo;Beyond This  Point You May Encounter Nude Sunbathers.&rdquo; Installed at West 18th Street, the  sculpture houses misting nozzles that spray water intermittently at passers-by.  Placing this work on the High Line, where nudity is not allowed draws attention  to the more risqu&eacute; social mores displayed on nearby billboards. The second  sculpture,&nbsp;<em>Sunbathers II</em>,  installed under The Standard, High Line, is a large, horizontal aluminum box  containing a giant fan and featuring a photograph of an ice cream cone. The  fan&rsquo;s movement is juxtaposed with the adjacent static image, mirroring the park  itself.</p>

Wanderlust,Various Artist,2016-04-21,2017-03-31,,"<p><em>Wanderlust</em> is a  group exhibition that explores the themes of walking, journeys, and  pilgrimages. Inspired by the High Line as an ambulatory space experienced most  naturally in motion, <em>Wanderlust</em> extends  the tradition of Conceptual art wherein the act of walking served as an  inspiration for many artists who explored life both in the urban context and in  an ambivalent confrontation with nature.</p>
<p>On the High Line, itself an urban promenade that combines  nature and architecture, the act of walking is both celebrated and taken for  granted. <em>Wanderlust</em> invites  viewers to remember the many implications of the journeys and walks they take  every day, placing them within a secular tradition that expands beyond art into  both everyday life and our shared cultural histories.</p>

Understanding,Martin Creed,2016-05-04,2016-10-23,,"<p>Times Square marquees, roadside signs, and advertising logos  are the stock&ndash;in&ndash;trade for giant neon signs. Martin Creed has adapted the  medium for his own colossal sign, proclaiming a word rather than selling a  product.

Spelled out in ten&ndash;foot&ndash;tall letters mounted on a 50&ndash;foot&ndash;long  steel I&ndash;beam,&nbsp;<em>Understanding</em>&nbsp;rotates  360 degrees, constantly shifting perspective on the work. The beam spins at  varying speeds, the rhythm determined by a computerized program designed by the  artist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A prolific interdisciplinary artist and musician, Martin Creed has become one  of Britain&rsquo;s best known artists for his playful, poetic, and sometimes  provocative work. Simple and direct,&nbsp;<em>Understanding</em>&nbsp;invites  us to make our own interpretations.

Once an industrial landfill and illegal dumping  ground, Socrates has transformed itself into New York City&rsquo;s preeminent  sculpture park and social space for public art, community engagement and urban  discovery. <em>LANDMARK</em> directly  addresses the idea of place as intimately tied to social and ecological  structures, to maintenance and stewardship, and to evolution over time.</p>

Her work offers an  ironically un&ndash;&ldquo;Spartan&rdquo; invitation through flashy forms, playful materials, and  saturated colors; more than the idealized promise of a gym or a workout, her  &ldquo;follies&rdquo; evoke a children&rsquo;s playground, calling viewers to explore, play and  be creative with these non&ndash;precious, interactive works of art. The works stand  as objects for both contemplation and active use, shifting from object to tool,  depending on public interaction, and thus invite visitors to explore the  intersection between objectification and functionality. This shifting &ndash; and the  playful reuse of leftover, inexpensive and readymade materials &ndash;also reflects  the continued adaptation, transformation and reinvention of Randall&rsquo;s Island,  in its different historical roles within New York City.</p>

"Hell Gate Cairns, FLOW.16",Samantha Holmes,2016-05-01,2016-11-30,,"<p>Samantha  Holmes&rsquo; Hell Gate Cairns are a series of stacked stone pillars, or cairns, that  stand watch over the southern coastline of Randall&rsquo;s Island Park. They are a  monument to the human creativity and industry with which we have shaped the  world around us, from land reclamation projects to the construction of  buildings and cities. Through their simplicity of structure, Holmes embodies  our impulse to imaginatively construct &ndash; stacking stones first in play, then as  architecture. Their verticality mirror that of the city beyond. The surface of  the cairns are covered in stone mosaic with flickers of glass and gold,  reflecting the light of sun and water, and turning the medium of mosaic upon  itself: stone celebrating stone, a symbol of the creative relationship between  man and nature. </p>
<p>By focusing  on the forms of natural stone, the piece draws attention to the boulders that  line the Park&rsquo;s paths and fields, remnants of the great earthmoving projects of  the 20th century that cleared the city&rsquo;s waterways &ndash; most notably the perilous  &ldquo;Hell Gate&rdquo;, the narrow stretch of water between Randall&rsquo;s Island and Queens  responsible for hundreds of early shipwrecks. The monument&rsquo;s placement at the  water&rsquo;s edge recalls these feats of human engineering, while further calling  upon the cairns&rsquo; symbolism as both a memorial to the deceased, and an ancient  sign of treacherous waters.</p>

"Monument to a Missing Island, FLOW.16",Tim Clifford,2016-05-01,2016-11-30,,"<p>Tim  Clifford&rsquo;s <em>Monument to a Missing Island</em> commemorates the destruction of the East River island known as Flood Rock,  which took place on October 10, 1885. Flood Rock was the largest impediment to  shipping in the East River, slowing commercial traffic to and from Long Island  Sound. The explosion that eliminated Flood Rock, overseen by the Army Corps of  Engineers, was the largest man-made explosion in human history prior to the  atom bomb.</p>
<p>The piece is  sited along the southern pathway of Randall&rsquo;s Island, in view of Flood Rock&rsquo;s  former location. The monument renders an image of the Flood Rock explosion  through the displacement of nearly 9000 lengths of wood (reminiscent of the  classic toy known as a &ldquo;pinscreen&rdquo;). Tipped on its side&ndash;so that both the bottom  and top of the monument are visible&ndash;Clifford&rsquo;s work literally upends the  traditional monument and illustrates the force and displacement at work in  man&rsquo;s carving of the East River channel.</p>

Unfurling,Mary Ann Unger,2016-05-16,2016-10-24,PS1 Greenstreet (Jackson Avenue and 46th Avenue),"<p>Created in 1986, <em>Unfurling</em> is  Mary Ann Unger&rsquo;s first artwork to be displayed with NYC Parks. Unger exhibited  her work at both MoMA PS 1 and SculptureCenter during her lifetime, bringing  her work full circle as it is installed adjacent to these Long Island City  institutions. <em>Unfurling</em> reveals the  dichotomy the artist was known for in her public artworks: geometric,  architectural forms crafted with strong, organic, man&ndash;made materials. Inspired  by nature, her curvilinear aluminum works allow an interplay between weight and  weightlessness, between mathematical structure and airy transparency. These works  are contemplative, inviting, and offer an opportunity for nature and the urban  environment to collaborate. This work was rendered in an intimate scale and is  elevated to the viewer&rsquo;s eye&ndash;level by a plinth. Unger had envisioned <em>Unfurling</em> as a larger piece, in keeping  with her other life&ndash;size public works; however, a larger version of this piece  was not realized in her lifetime. </p>

Big Bling,Martin Puryear,2016-05-16,2017-04-02,,"<p>This temporary outdoor work, the thirty&ndash;third public art  exhibition mounted by Mad. Sq. Art, the free contemporary art program of  Madison Square Park Conservancy, is a multi&ndash;tier wood structure wrapped in fine  chain&ndash;link fence. A gold&ndash;leafed shackle is anchored near the top of the  structure. At forty feet high, Big Bling achieves colossal scale and elicits a  range of readings, stimulating diverse and profound interpretations of its  meaning. </p>
<p>The largest temporary outdoor sculpture Puryear has created,  Big Bling is part animal form, part abstract sculpture, and part intellectual  meditation. The artist&rsquo;s signature organic vocabulary appears in a graceful,  sinewy outline and an amoeboid form in the work&rsquo;s center. Big Bling&rsquo;s  architectural language suggests a building that is accessible by ascension  through its levels. Its stories are obstructed by chain&ndash;link fence, a barrier  to entry, which covers all visible surfaces of the sculpture. In contrast to  the coarse materials employed throughout most of the work, the gold shackle is  a shimmering beacon that simultaneously adorns and restrains. </p>

This is Carri&oacute;n&lsquo;s second public installation with Parks, the first of  which was in Manhattan in 2014. &Acirc; The  threefold public art installation, community garden, and educational center for  community discussion derives from a series of videotaped, at-home interviews  conducted by Carri&oacute;n with immigrants living in Brooklyn. The interviewees are  asked about their personal experiences with cultural adaptation and coexistence  since arriving in New York. At the end of the discussion, each interviewee  selects a plant that exists in both their country of origin and the United States  to be planted in the garden. </p>
<p>This 230-square-foot  garden is in the shape of Brooklyn and features 36 different plants chosen by  immigrants living in the borough. Placed according to the interviewees&rsquo;  physical locations within Brooklyn, the plants represent the immigrants, their  communities, and the diversity of the borough. All these plants will coexist  side-by-side in this impossible garden. The survival of the garden is dependent  on its free public programs that include weekly hands-on gardening workshops  organized in partnership with local organizations and institutions.</p>

MORPHOUS,Lionel Smit,2016-06-13,2017-04-30,,"<p><em>MORPHOUS</em> is an exploration of hybrid identity and its ever-changing nature within South Africa&rsquo;s social landscape. This bronze sculpture, featuring the conjoined heads of two outward-gazing young women, evokes the question of time, of past and future, and a societal commentary without judgment. The &ldquo;double-vision&rdquo; portrayed in this work is simultaneously a foretelling of things to come and an acknowledgement of what has already passed. The figures are charged with an emotive and gestural energy, a hallmark of Smit&rsquo;s evocative work. The spontaneous gestures in his three dimensional figural forms animate the beauty and grace of the faces he sees in the neighborhoods around his studio. The scale of his work invokes both a sense of celebration and power. </p>

Meridian (Gold),Mika Tajima,2016-06-09,2016-08-31,,"<p><em>Meridian (Gold)</em>&nbsp;by Mika Tajima is an illuminated plume of water vapor whose color shifts between magenta and pale cyan. The color of the vapor corresponds in real-time to the global sentiment for gold, reflected in the price fluctuation of the commodity. Gold is a peculiar material that derives its value from the social perception of its qualities and collective &quot;moods&quot; toward geopolitical and economic events. The framing structure for <em>Meridian (Gold)</em> is a seating zone that references communal rejuvenation spas and here becomes a site to reflect on the fleeting materiality of contemporary life.

<p> <em>Public Process</em> is an intensive program for high school students that uses New York City&rsquo;s rich public art landscape to explore the history and impact of public art and its community influence. In July 2015, eight high school students participated in a two-week course providing interactions and presentations by seasoned professional curators, architects, local historians, and public art organization representatives, and opportunities to visit public art sites. Three artists were invited to make proposals for a public artwork in Long Island City and presented them to the students in their studios. On the last day of the course, the students made presentations and debated the proposals, ultimately selecting Tajima&rsquo;s project for the commission.</p>

Marking the program&rsquo;s fifth and the park&rsquo;s  thirtieth anniversaries, Folly 2016 marks a departure from previous years&rsquo;  competitions by&nbsp;asking entrants&nbsp;to design a functional structure to  enhance the park&rsquo;s public programs.

The title  suggests processes observed in the fragmented assemblage and questions  relations between nature, humans and technology.  The breakdown of the recycled tree trunk into  equal-sized units portrays scientific instrumentality involved in the removal  of natural material from cycles that benefit all life on Earth, for human  salvation and profiteering.</p>

Farber hopes that this  work will serve as a reminder that communities can come together and find a  sustainable way in which to move forward.

The mural is a  site-specific installation designed to activate the park and to create a more  pedestrian-friendly experience along E. 161st Street between the bustling  courthouse center at Morris Avenue and the less trafficked three-block stretch  to Elton Avenue. A team of young DreamYard artists and an intergenerational  team of community volunteers installed the mural, spurring conversation,  creativity, and a new favorite destination among community members and groups.</p>
<p> The mural&rsquo;s abstract forms and vibrant colors reenergize Railroad Park,  the adjacent NYCHA Morrisania Air Rights building, and the path to the  often-overlooked Metro North Station directly behind it.

For this community-based, public art project the  artist chose an image from her 2008 parachute series, which she gridded into 72  square tiles and printed in the four basic CMYK colors. The tiles were then  enhanced with colored pencils by young artists who explored mark making  techniques with CMA Teaching Artists. The colored pieces were returned to the  artist, who reassembled the composition. Each piece can be singled out in the  larger composition, but when taken within the whole piece, each specific style  blends into the overall picture.

For centuries blue roses were created by adding blue dye to white roses, but in 2004 a Japanese company produced a blue rose through genetic engineering. </p>
<p> Appropriately, folklore of various cultures often use the blue rose as symbols of the impossible or unattainable. In tales and poetry, it has also represented unrequited love, blinding phantasm, and deceptive illusion.

For this installation, he considered both the practical and aesthetic experiences of the viewer. The sculpture conveys a sense of spiritual presence and prompts park visitors to contemplate the past, present, and future of sculpture in tandem with that of the park.

Wishing wells were believed to grant requests by way of magical waters or deities residing within. Visitors of all ages are encouraged to speak a wish into the well. The words are translated into a video ripple inside, and an echo repeats the words back. Turning the well&rsquo;s crank activates video and microphone recordings, which are captured in a database inside the sculpture. The recordings will be curated and presented on a dedicated website, wishingwellnyc.org, bringing the artwork beyond the physical space of the park. </p>
<p>The Dyckman Farmhouse, a Dutch Colonial style farmhouse built c. 1784, was opened as a museum in 1916. Today it is nestled in a small garden and is an extraordinary reminder of early Manhattan and important part of the diverse Inwood neighborhood. The original well has long been absent from the house, although a replacement well-head was constructed around 1915-1916 during the restoration of the farmhouse. This well-head was removed sometime in the 1980&rsquo;s and replaced by a simple wood platform. Installed at the site of the original well on the Dyckman property, Long&rsquo;s video sculpture enlivens the vacant well site as a fantasy restoration. </p>

Korstanje&rsquo;s  site&ndash;specific installation consists of five sculptures and continues her  investigations into the way art can intervene in the processes of the natural  world. The sculptures are made from a mix of natural and human-made materials  and are designed to serve as attractive homes for solitary bees. Unlike  domesticated bees, solitary bees live alone, rather than in collective hives.  Designed as much for use by the garden&rsquo;s natural fauna as they are for the  enjoyment of its human visitors, the sculptures will alter with the changing of  the seasons.</p>
<p>Korstanje&ndash;a Dutch artist whose mother is a  beekeeper&ndash;began her involvement with bees in 2006 in the midst of the first  scientific reports of colony collapse disorder, in which a large number of  honeybee colonies in North America and Europe suddenly and mysteriously  disappeared. Traced to the use of industrial pesticides, among other causes,  this phenomenon still poses a serious threat to agricultural production in the  world, where bees play an essential role in pollinating many crops. Korstanje&rsquo;s  installation is meant to visually suggest swarming masses of insects, while the  incorporated bamboo sticks and their hollow interiors also provide ready-made  nesting grounds. </p>

Monument to the Unelected,Nina Katchadourian,2016-11-05,2016-11-13,Lefferts Historic House,"<p>This  temporary installation, consisting of 58 signs bearing the names of the losing  candidates from every presidential election in American history, coincides with  this year&rsquo;s presidential election, and once the results are official, it will  eventually include a sign with the name of the loser of the 2016 Presidential  Election. At the moment when the country is deeply preoccupied with a major  national election, <em>Monument to the  Unelected</em> serves as a reminder of the country's collective political road  not taken. It does not reflect any particular political viewpoint or endorse  any particular party. It has been exhibited during two past presidential  election cycles, usually spanning the time before and after the election. </p>
<p>Katchadourian  was originally commissioned by the Scottsdale Museum of Art to create a new  work around the time of the 2008 presidential election and became interested in  the plastic election signs sprouting up around Scottsdale. The signs struck her  as an American tradition of sorts and with an aesthetic all their own. Each  sign was made in a contemporary design vernacular, even if it advertised a  candidate from a previous century. None of the signs are designs that were used  in the candidates&rsquo; actual election campaigns. Many of the signs borrow directly  from the designs of signs in Scottsdale; others were modeled on signs in other  parts of the country. All the signs are printed using similar commercial  production methods as common election signage.</p>

New York Made: Stanton Street Courts,KAWS,2016-11-17,2017-11-16,,"<p><em>New York Made: Stanton Street  Courts</em> by KAWS encompass two side-by-side full basketball courts  (approximately 116 by 80 feet), as well as four hoops.  &ldquo;My approach to the courts was very similar  to how I would work on canvas. I wanted to create something that was true to my  language, but also considerate of this being a court that people are playing  on,&rdquo; the Brooklyn&ndash;based, world&ndash;renowned artist Brian Donnelly (KAWS) explains.  &ldquo;I wanted to find the sweet spot where it works visually and functionally &ndash; how  its broken up by the game&rsquo;s lines and works with my images. It will have an  intimate effect on the players that use the court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>KAWS first moved to Manhattan in 1996, and lived on the corner of  Clinton and Stanton Street. His familiarity with the park and its neighborhood  is thus extremely personal.</p>

Double Doily,Jennifer Cecere,2016-11-18,2017-11-17,PS1 Greenstreet (Jackson Avenue and 46th Avenue),"<p>Jennifer Cecere&rsquo;s  artwork aims to integrate a feeling of domestic handiwork into the built  environment. Doilies were invented by industrious women to hide and protect  worn and frayed furnishings (maybe feelings too). Through the variety of  materials that they can be made from, the ways in which they can be displayed,  and their references to a variety of subject matter makes doilies very diverse.  This double&ndash;sided, doily&ndash;shaped bench enlivens this small park in the midst of  a busy thoroughfare and new construction by taking something intimate and  domestic and placing it outdoors. The handicraft of the bench demonstrates a  familiarity with domestic materials that ties us with our fragile environment  and revives traditions that when integrated with art and architecture reflect  our hopes and dreams. </p>",Q,40.745568,-73.946569,1

This  oversized birdhouse, which is boarded up and placed under foreclosure, sits in  the heart of a neighborhood that is one of the most historical and notable  examples of New York City&rsquo;s gentrification and the real estate bubble. Simply  put, the city has become so expensive that even the birds cannot afford to live  here. This work is Aaron Schaeter&rsquo;s first public sculpture exhibition. </p>

Data from the 2015 American Census Survey takes visual, sculptural form in 33 metal poles, inscribed and hued to represent the national origins and shifting populations of foreign-born NYC residents. As visitors travel around the sculpture to a designated observation point, their perspective shifts until the individual color blocks of red and pink resolve into an iconic heart.</p>
<p>Conceived as both a striking visual object and as a point of dialogue and conversation, <em>We Were Strangers Once Too</em> champions the value of diversity in the city, and specifically the city&rsquo;s immigrant populations, new and old, at a time when they are increasingly under siege.</p>

Sculptural Models for the High Line Plinth,Various Artists,2017-02-10,2017-04-30,,"<p>On view on the High Line at West 14th Street, this exhibition showcases 12 sculptural models of shortlisted proposals for the High Line Plinth, a new landmark destination for major public art commissions. Located on the High Line at West 30th Street and 10th Avenue, the High Line Plinth was designed as the focal point of the Spur, the newest section of the High Line. The Plinth is one of the only sites in New York City dedicated solely to a changing series of new, contemporary art commissions. The High Line Plinth is inspired by the Fourth Plinth in London&rsquo;s Trafalgar Square, a widely respected, high-profile venue for a changing program of temporary commissioned artworks, whose influence reaches far beyond the art world and inspires dialogue amongst the general public. </p>
<p>After collecting and reviewing more than 50 proposals from a wide range of artists recommended by an international advisory committee, High Line Art has selected 12 shortlisted proposals by artists&nbsp;Jonathan Berger, Minerva Cuevas, Jeremy Deller, Sam Durant, Charles Gaines, Lena Henke, Matthew Day Jackson, Simone Leigh, Roman Ondak, Paola Pivi, Haim Steinbach, and Cosima von Bonin.&nbsp;The artists are a diverse group in terms of age, nationality, and stage in their careers. In spring 2017, two out of the 12 shortlisted proposals will be selected as the first two High Line Plinth commissions. The first artwork will be installed in 2018 to coincide with the opening of the Spur, and each artwork will be on view for 18 months.</p>

His color&ndash;blocked compositions evoke compassion  and a sense of shared space, setting the viewer in close conversation with  those pictured.</p>
<p>  For the High Line, Taylor presents a  new version of a self-portrait adapted specifically for its setting on the side  of a building at West 22nd Street. The work depicts the artist and a friend  &ldquo;blissed out,&rdquo; relaxing in a swimming pool at a friend&rsquo;s house in Palm Springs.  Reminiscent of David Hockney&rsquo;s paintings of Los Angeles swimming pools from the  1960s, <em>the floaters</em>, a title which references the eponymous  Detroit R&amp;B group, portrays the artist in a moment of pure,  leisurely happiness.</p><p>This exhibition is presented by <a href=""http://art.thehighline.org/"">High Line Art</a>.</p>",M,40.747334,-74.005167,1

With  poetic finesse, Lle&oacute; carves into the thick and dense sandstone, which he  combines with ancestral fresco painting to create a tension between color and  form.

Sited at Pier 1 in Brooklyn Bridge Park, this massive, continuously  spiraling funnel of water will harness one of the most evanescent of materials  and create a striking contrast with the adjacent East River. Kapoor, among the  most influential artists of his generation, has had a career-long engagement  with space and the limits of perception. With <em>Descension</em>, he has created a dynamic negative space that descends  into the ground, disturbing the familiar boundaries of our world. In the midst  of a quintessential New York park, Kapoor invites us to experience the sheer  perceptual wonder of an ordinary material like water made to behave in an  extraordinary way. </p>

The exhibition is the 10th sculpture show that the Broadway Mall Association has presented on the malls since 2005. Brown&rsquo;s rounded forms and use of bronze convey the heavy gravity of stone. The playful expressions and gestures of her figures transcend that weight, suggesting warmth and lightness of being. Simplicity of form and earth-toned patina evoke a feeling of stillness and peace.&nbsp;The influence of the Japanese aesthetic on Brown&rsquo;s sculpture springs from her childhood in Japan and apprenticeship in traditional Japanese ceramics.</p>

Flame,William Logan,2017-05-15,2018-04-14,,"<p>With a background in architecture and design, William Logan has focused on large scale public sculpture for the past 15 years. Drawing and model-making have been constant endeavors while his experience in engineering and boat-building has given him an intuitive feel for structure. Flame is the result of experimental work with carbon fiber and lightweight structures. The intricate surface texture reflects the laborious effort that went into the fabrication of the piece by hand and allows the piece to catch the light in unexpected ways. The open lattice of the upper element lends the work a diaphanous quality, while its construction in aluminum gives it structure.</p>",M,40.760939,-73.964251,1

Visitors are invited to take part in chess games during open park hours in which they take the place of chess pieces, their positions determined by their familial relationships to others. In order to play, visitors bring a group of 32 people together, who will be &ldquo;played&rdquo; by two additional people. Visitors are encouraged to assemble teams with their own friends or family, or to branch out and recruit strangers also visiting the High Line. Referring to the onsite instructions, the group self-organizes according to <em>chess: relatives</em> rules. </p>
<p> Once the group is organized into the pieces they fit into, the two players play the game, moving the human &ldquo;pieces&rdquo; as in a standard game of chess. Once the game begins, the players are no longer allowed to ask for clarification on what kind of piece each person represents. As one of the most interactive artworks exhibited on the High Line, <em>chess: relatives</em> will spark new connections, conversations, and debate amongst visitors. The piece also gives visitors the chance to become a part of an artwork that aims to ask more questions about art than it can answer.</p>

Prismatic Park,Josiah McElheny,2017-06-13,2017-10-08,,"<p><em>Prismatic Park</em> features three large sculptures of painted wood and prismatic glass by artist and MacArthur Foundation Fellow recipient Josiah McElheny. The minimal, almost architectural forms create new spaces within the Park for the creation of music, dance, and poetry: a curvilinear, translucent blue sound wall for experimental music; a circular, reflective green floor for vanguard dance; and a vaulted-roofed luminous red and yellow pavilion for poetry. Each will refract the surrounding natural light, beckoning the passerby and regular Park visitor. The three structures will form open, stage-like platforms for the collaborating choreographers, dancers, musicians, and poets who will be working next to them, on them, and under them in the summer of 2017.</p>
<p> Throughout the exhibition, three nonprofit art organizations based in New York&ndash;Blank Forms, Danspace Project, and Poets House&ndash;will &ldquo;inhabit&rdquo; the Park to realize new commissions. The resident artists will create ambitious new work that summons the potential for imagination, creativity, and performance inspired by spontaneous audiences and chance encounters that only a public place, like an urban park, can offer. <br>

The Family Imprint,Nancy Borowick,2017-06-10,2017-10-31,At Washington and Prospect Streets,"<p><em>The Family Imprint</em> is an intimate story of family, as the humanitarian photographer Nancy Borowick&rsquo;s parents underwent parallel treatments for stage-four cancer. The story is about life and love more than cancer and death. In a sense, it reads and feels like a scrapbook&mdash;and is filled with decades of saved loved letters, keepsakes and other clues about her family members&rsquo; lives, enriching the larger story which she had been photographing for a few years already. The project, which was formally known as <em>Cancer Family Ongoing</em>, was published nationally and internationally, has received international awards and recognition, most recently a World Press Photo award in 2016. Here, Borowick&rsquo;s images are reproduced on vinyl banners. While deeply personal, this work touches all who pass by it in this public space.</p>

Hell Gate Cairns,Samantha Holmes,2017-08-20,2018-08-11,,"<p><em>Hell Gate Cairns</em> is a series of stacked stone pillars, or cairns, that stand watch over the western coastline of Riverside Park. By focusing on the forms of natural stone, the piece draws attention to the boulders that line the waterfront, remnants of the great earthmoving projects of the 20th century that cleared the city&rsquo;s waterways, including the perilous &ldquo;Hell Gate&rdquo;. The monument&rsquo;s placement at the water&rsquo;s edge recalls these feats of human engineering, while further calling upon the cairns&rsquo; symbolism as an ancient sign of treacherous waters. Their verticality a reflection of the nearby skyline, the <em>Hell Gate Cairns</em> aim to embody the human impulse to imaginative construction &ndash; stacking stones first in play, then as architecture.</p>",M,40.777367,-73.990979,1
City,Rob Fischer,2017-09-11,2017-11-15,Park Avenue Malls at 54th Street,"<p><em>City</em> consists of a multi-chambered structure made of glass, steel, and cast aluminum. Each chamber is at least partially see-through, with some revealing their enclosed contents through clear glass, while others are empty or partially obscured by swaths of colorful silkscreen ink. With its tower like components, this sculpture refers to the ambition of building skyscrapers, of setting out, of going from one place to another, in search of success. It is a poetic sea and strata of bold colors filled with art history reference, pop influence, noise of the streets, billboard imagery, and the signage and literature of the city. As with much of Fischer&rsquo;s work, <em>City</em> will change over time, creating a singular and ever-evolving experience. </p>

Freedman Plaza,"<p>Created from fiberglass and covered with an intricate pattern, the 23-foot-tall Wind Sculpture (SG) I will rise above the plaza, reminiscent of the untethered sail of a ship billowing in the breeze. Its unique, hand-painted pattern in turquoise, red, and orange &mdash; colors that the artist associates with his childhood on the beaches of Lagos &mdash; is inspired by Dutch wax batik print, which Shonibare has called the &ldquo;perfect metaphor for multilayered identities.&rdquo; This is the first work in a second generation of his celebrated Wind Sculpture series and continues Shonibare&rsquo;s ongoing examination of the construction of cultural identity through the lens of colonialism. The work creates an opportunity to reflect on social issues, including the movement of people and ideas across borders and the role of monuments in heterogeneous societies.&nbsp;</p>

Iannone&rsquo;s piece was conceived before the recent months of upheaval in the United States around immigration, an already contested topic; these recent debates have raised the Statue of Liberty anew as a symbol of the openness of New York City and the United States to those seeking asylum, freedom, or simply a better life.

The prism facets are inspired by the luminous arrays of elegantly designed paint chips found in local hardware emporia and home furnishing mega-stores alike.

The exhibition looks at the power of art to change society, the role of art in public space, and whether art can be a form of protest.

This installation promotes ideas of transformation, immigration and community. It honors the opportunities that this city offers to newcomers, but most of all, it acknowledges the labor and efforts that immigrants contribute in return. Consisting of 100 metallic and brightly-colored sculptures arranged in a circle on the lawn, the sculptures are modeled after tightly swaddled babies, or &ldquo;guaguas,&rdquo; that the artist saw while living in Ecuador.

Ruttenberg is admired by critics and curators for her fantastical narrative sculptures that combine human, animal, and plant forms. Taken out of the gallery and onto the streets, her characters embrace even greater significance as they interact with the urban environment. Ruttenberg has painstakingly studied the sites along Broadway, and her carefully placed polychrome players blur the lines between dream and reality. In the Broadway malls installation, she explores a broad mix of sculptural media including patinated bronze, glass mosaic, transparent cast resin, and carefully orchestrated LED lighting.

Throughout her career, Barlow has constantly revisited works to reconfigure them, often in consideration of a new context. The work consists of two large concrete panels, with holes cut from their centers; set on stilts, the work appears like a character teetering among the planks at its base and emerging from the planting beds below. The sculpture stands on a railway spur at 16th Street that used to run directly into a refrigerated warehouse immediately north of Chelsea Market, formerly a Nabisco cookie factory. As with much of Barlow&rsquo;s oeuvre, the work points to the area&rsquo;s industrial past and how architecture, like art, is perpetually cannibalized from one generation to the next.

Simmons&rsquo;s work references the conditions and forms of migration, political and leisure travel, transport, and refuge, as well as the practices of documenting and representing the location and movement of people. Abstracting the visual identities of individual flags, Simmons acknowledges the complex interplay between national, cultural, and ethnic subjects, as well as the reality that allegiances to flags are often imperfect reflections of individual or collective identities. Presenting visual information that is hard to decipher, <i>Convene</i> suggests that statistics found in any set of data need critical engagement in order to be put to use.</p>

Her material choices&ndash;fundamental elements for construction and fabrication&ndash;combined with her axiomatic approach to process, evoke narratives of self-reliance, creative constraints, and expediency. Overton creates new iterations of ongoing forms &ndash; altered pick-up trucks, a water feature, a roof truss gem sculpture, a suspended work, and a billboard, among others.<p>Weaving together these works is their shared role as support structures, both in their original purpose and in their new generative articulations. The wooden beams and trusses are elements that repeat through the exhibition, revealing these materials&rsquo; multiple capacities as tools. Situated in the changing, once-industrial waterfront neighborhood of Long Island City, the works shed their former functions without nostalgia. Instead, Overton&rsquo;s works exhibit the vitality of creative reuse, the ingenuity of traditional forms of vernacular making, and an entwined admiration and wonder towards the physical and material world around us.</p>

Artists Walis Johnson and Paul Sue Pat collaborate to create <em>East New York: We Walk in a Field of Dreams</em>, a socially engaged multi-media art installation that incorporates community oral histories, a labyrinth walk and sculptural creations. It explores the past and future of East New York, a predominantly African-American and Puerto Rican middle and working class neighborhood in Brooklyn long neglected by the city, now on the verge of enormous change as a result of city rezoning. It considers neighborhood history, hopes and dreams and the persistence of residents and institutions who have served as community place-keepers and healers in spite of many obstacles.</p>

The shrine becomes a place for reflection in preparation to walk the Red Line Labyrinth using thematic prompts to focus the mind and heart in meditation. Created from old shoes, The Labyrinth, poetically embodies footsteps of a resilient people who have come, gone or still reside in East New York. As people emerge from the Labyrinth, they enter into a new space, a field of tall grasses and flowers that speak of hope and with luck, a brighter future.

The piece&rsquo;s design is taken from the elaborate frescoes of Tiebele, Burkina Faso, the royal court of the Kassena people, where every home is hand-painted. Armstead&rsquo;s public artwork transforms the two-dimensional marks into translucent perforated steel forms on a two-ton angle iron steel frame.<p></p><p><em>Washington 20/20/20</em> is an African architectural adornment to the solid granite base of the existing park monument.

The Wall,Griselda San Martin,2018-08-21,2019-01-31,,"A large scale photographic public art exhibition at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge pedestrian entrance, The Wall is a series of photographic banners that display photographer&nbsp;Griselda San Martin's powerful project about the wall that divides the United States and Mexico. At the juncture of San Diego, California and Tijuana, Mexico, the border wall&rsquo;s rusting steel bars plunge into the sand, extending 300 feet into the Pacific Ocean, and cast a long and conflicting shadow. The images on the banners were captured in Friendship Park, a stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border where families meet to share intimate moments through the metal fence that separates them.<p>Physical borders create symbolic boundaries that reinforce the rhetoric of &ldquo;us versus them&rdquo; and become enduring, permanent features of the geopolitical landscape that send a forceful message of exclusion. By calling attention to the human interactions at Friendship Park, Griselda San Martin attempts to neutralize what this wall was built to create: separation.</p>

Viewfinding,Sarah E. Brook,2018-09-04,2019-08-22,,"<p><em>Viewfinding</em> is a public art installation and queer poetry collaboration by New York-based artist Sarah E. Brook in Riverside Park South. It is a dimensional painting, interactive light sculpture, and a haven for private reflection. Brook&rsquo;s sculptures and installations utilize translucency, layering, color gradients and architectural references to investigate the relationship between expansive external and internal (psychic) space, exploring how vastness can dismantle limiting narratives of being. <em>Viewfinding</em> consists of five wooden trapezoidal components, installed one behind the next and connected by a meandering bench that mimics the river nearby and interacts with the sun setting over the Hudson River. Strips of cast acrylic are fixed within each trapezoid, painted in gradations of color that progress from rich blue to fiery pink, referencing the color progression of a sky at sunset. On the bench are a series of 26 acrylic panels engraved with short works by queer poets&mdash;selected through an open call--on the theme of transformation and self-actualization.&nbsp; Visible to viewers who engage closely with the work, the text will provide rich and varied entry points into the piece.</p>

This otherworldly landscape can be a site of reflection for contradictions and our complicity in the face of looming environmental destruction.

Tension Sculptures,Joseph La Piana,2019-03-05,2019-08-11,"53rd Street, 57th Street, 60th Street, 67th Street, and 70th Street","<em>Tension Sculptures</em> is a series of five sculptures of varying dimensions that bring together Joseph La Piana&rsquo;s conceptual heredity and interest in activating passive materiality. With <em>Tension Sculptures</em>, the rigid, linear nature of La Piana&rsquo;s ongoing <em>Tension Paintings</em> series exploring the boundaries of tensile strength is translated into three dimensions, comprising monochromatic yellow rubber stretched between and wrapped around stainless steel armatures, akin to a cats-cradle. The sculptures&rsquo; need to remain in a constant state of tension is essential to their physical composition, and as a result the artist refers to them as &ldquo;living sculptures.&rdquo; The artist finds parallels between the sculptures and the current experiences of individuals on a global, social scale. Every day, tensions are promulgated by conflicts&mdash;whether political, social, environmental, or interpersonal. La Piana&rsquo;s sculptures, stretched to their capacity, echo this state of cultural and emotional disruption.<p></p>

Tilted Head,Mark Manders,2019-03-06,2019-09-01,Doris C. Freedman Plaza,"<p>With <em>Tilted Head</em>, parkgoers will encounter a 13-foot-tall androgynous, detached human head in classical repose, seemingly made of drying moldable clay, but actually cast in bronze. The archetypally minimalist head is mysteriously incomplete, missing a third or more of its form, and is accompanied by remnants of cast bronze objects that appear left behind as if the sculpture was abandoned in the studio, frozen in time. Tensions are evident throughout: the serenity of the face is countered by the disruption of the cracking surface, figurative representation veers towards abstraction of form. Timelessness and specificity meet, allowing viewers to project their own meaning and construct their own narratives about this colossal bodily fragment. <em>Tilted Head</em> is the artist&rsquo;s largest single cast bronze sculpture to date and brings Mark Manders&rsquo; highly distinctive style to an outdoor exhibition in New York for the first time.</p>

"Ecology Sampler: 40.684523 Latitude, -73.886898 Longitude",Daniele Frazier,2019-03-20,2020-03-19,,"<em>Ecology Sampler</em> by Daniele Frazier is a 6&rsquo; x 10&rsquo; handmade flag depicting fifteen notable creatures that live or migrate through Highland Park and the Ridgewood Reservoir in Brooklyn. The flag is flanked by eight additional flags along the yardarm that highlight the silhouettes of local tree leaves. Atop the 30-foot flag pole is an eight-inch-diameter, hand painted earth.<p>Flags are typically used to mark territories, boundaries, and ownership. In this case, Frazier subverts their normal use by displaying living things and migrating species that do not know or abide by boundaries.</p>

<p>In quilting a sampler is a quilt that does not repeat the same block pattern within its layout &ndash; a representative collection of one's technical skillset. In this case, the public artwork is not only a sampler of quilt blocks, but a sampler of the local ecology.</p>

<p>The site for this artwork is on the Atlantic Flyway bird migratory path, and features a large body of water. These two characteristics make this park, which is a protected wetland, a uniquely hospitable ecosystem for migrating birds. There are over 160 bird species that inhabit or travel through Highland Park, in addition to a diverse network of local plants and wildlife. Through educating the community about its unique flora and fauna, Frazier hopes to inspire a new generation of citizen conservationists to keep urban communities safe and clean for all wildlife species.</p>",B,40.684528,-73.886889,1
Silent Agitator,Ruth Ewan,2019-04-03,2020-03-31,,"For the High Line, Scottish artist Ruth Ewan presents a monumental-scale, double-sided clock on the park at 24th Street, also visible from street level. The clock is based on an illustration originally produced for the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) labor union by the North American writer and labor activist Ralph Chaplin. The illustration was one of many images that appeared on &ldquo;stickerettes,&rdquo; known as &ldquo;silent agitators,&rdquo; millions of which were printed in red and black on gummed paper and distributed by union members traveling from job to job. The clock nods to the round-the-clock organizing work of the IWW, and the ubiquity of the clock in labor struggles: both the ways that factory owners separated private and public time and the fights for the now-diminishing labor rights we have today, such as the five-day work week and eight-hour workday. The installation is Ruth Ewan&rsquo;s first public artwork in the United States.<p></p>

En Plein Air,Various Artists,2019-04-19,2020-03-30,Multiple locations,"?<em>En Plein Air</em>, inspired by the unique site of the High Line, examines and expands the tradition of outdoor painting. The title refers to the mid-19th century practice of&nbsp;<em>en&nbsp;plein&nbsp;air</em>&nbsp;painting (French for &ldquo;in the open air&rdquo;). The inclination to paint outside was one reaction to the overwhelming transformations of life in urban centers, as nature and cities redefined each other under the pressure of modernization&mdash;a history that connects to that of the High Line, a remnant of the industrial era of the neighborhood. The artists in the exhibition not only bring painting outside but imagine nature as context, subject, and collaborator. They approach the history, methodologies, and content of outdoor painting from a variety of perspectives. The High Line is an apt site for the consideration of the importance of landscape painting in our time, as the natural features of the park juxtapose with the artificial scenery of the surrounding billboards, building facades and walls, and variety of advertisements. Through the participation of an international group of artists,&nbsp;<em>En Plein Air</em>&nbsp;challenges the kinds of work traditionally associated with public art&mdash;sculptures and murals&mdash;by presenting freestanding, outdoor paintings that can be viewed in the round and in dialogue with the surrounding landscapes.<p></p>

Community: You never really know your own language until you study another,Jose Carlos Casado,2019-04-06,2020-04-05,,"<p>Jose&nbsp;Carlos Casado&rsquo;s installation reflects typical protest posters that people make for different public manifestations. Where protest signs normally reflect someone&rsquo;s opinion on a matter,&nbsp;Jose's&nbsp;sculptures become unique portraits of people from within the community.&nbsp;Jose&nbsp;worked with 10 volunteers from the community, capturing images of their palms and running these photos through 3D imaging software, creating an abstraction of the hand. As no two palms are alike, these photos capture the uniqueness of a person. The rear side of each structure also reflects the volunteers; they are painted in the pantone color matching that person&rsquo;s skin tone and include text about the person it represents.</p>

<p>Participation is a key theme throughout&nbsp;Jose&nbsp;public artwork.

Subliminal Standard,Harold Ancart,2019-05-01,2020-03-01,,"<em>Subliminal Standard</em>, an interactive new commission by Brooklyn-based, Belgian-born artist&nbsp;Harold Ancart. The artist has constructed a large scale painted concrete sculpture inspired by New York City&rsquo;s ubiquitous handball courts, which have fascinated Ancart for years because of their unexpected relationship to the history of abstraction. The painting references the traditional boundary lines of the court and the inadvertent abstract compositions created when city courts are repaired and repainted to mask graffiti and weathering over time.<p>Popularized by early 20th century immigrants to the United States, handball is among the most democratic sports, requiring nothing more than a small ball and a wall to play. The handball court is also the only type of playground that offers a freestanding double-sided wall which, according to the artist, &ldquo;offers a unique possibility to show painting in a public space.&rdquo; Ancart&rsquo;s immersive sculpture will create a place for interaction, while bringing to light the ever-present painterly qualities that inherently exist in the structure of the handball court.&nbsp; The title of the work poetically references the unintended abstract compositions and patterns created through their use and wear in relation to the standard lines that mark the limits of the playgrounds.&nbsp;</p>

The site positions the work at the feet of brand new residential buildings. Like its neighbors, Keegan&rsquo;s work is constructed mostly in transparent panes, a model home approaching 1:1 scale. Its interior floor shows an enlarged dollhouse view of an empty one-bedroom rental apartment in the Hayden, a building across Jackson Avenue.</p><p>On three sides, the phrase &ldquo;For a long time this neighborhood was about what will be, and now I think it&rsquo;s about what is.&rdquo; traces the upper edges of the sculpture. The quotation is pulled from a developer&rsquo;s comment in a 2017 New York Times article titled &ldquo;Long Island City Grows Ever Skyward.&rdquo; Expressing the apotheosis of longtime speculative interest in Long Island City, it takes stock of the present with a puzzling formulation of self-reflection. If Long Island City is now &ldquo;about what is,&rdquo; then what is it about? Has &ldquo;what will be&rdquo; turned out to be &ldquo;what is&rdquo;? What was the present like when it was ostensibly about the future? The phrase begs the question of whose timeline and whose sense of anticipation guides narratives of a neighborhood&rsquo;s arrival. To this end, the sculpture&rsquo;s back wall is made of mirrored glass, a surface capturing a constant stream of traffic and passersby inside.</p>

Brick House,Simone Leigh,2019-06-05,2020-09-30,,"<p>For the inaugural High Line Plinth commission, Simone Leigh presents&nbsp;<em>Brick House</em>, a sixteen-foot-tall bronze bust of a Black woman. The&nbsp;torso is a combination of the forms of a skirt and a clay house. The figure stands tall and monumental atop the Plinth, gazing resolutely down 10th Avenue.&nbsp;<em> Brick House</em>&nbsp;is the first monumental work in&nbsp;<em>Anatomy of Architecture</em>, Leigh&rsquo;s continuing series of sculptures that combine architectural forms from regions as varied as West Africa and the American South with the human body. The sculpture references numerous architectural forms: Batammaliba architecture from Benin and Togo; the&nbsp;<em>teleuk</em>&nbsp;of the Mousgoum people of Cameroon and Chad; and the restaurant Mammy&rsquo;s Cupboard in the southern U.S. All three references inform both the formal elements of the work&mdash;the conflated image of woman and architecture&mdash;and its conceptual framework.</p>

<p>Leigh&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Brick House</em>&nbsp;will be centered on the Spur, standing in sharp contrast to the disparate elements of the immediate architectural landscape. The Plinth is the focal point of the Spur, a site whose architectural and human scales are in constant vertiginous negotiation, surrounded by a competitive landscape of glass-and-steel towers shooting up from among older industrial-era brick buildings. In this space, Leigh&rsquo;s magnificent Black female figure challenges visitors to think more immediately about the architecture around them, and how it reflects customs, values, priorities, and society as a whole.</p>

Waiting for the session to begin,Bryan Rodriguez Cambana,2019-07-19,2019-08-04,Boardwalk Pavilion at West 21 Street,"<p><em>Waiting for the session to begin</em>&nbsp;is a public art installation by Bryan Rodriguez Cambana that reflects on the seemingly disparate spaces in which music, therapy, and the confines of the criminal justice system commingle. Comprised of a sound installation and outdoor sculpture, <em>Waiting for the session to begin</em>, depicts observational drawings of sleeping correctional officers and incarcerated youth in Rikers Island. The title refers to the artist&rsquo;s time as an educator working on a hip hop project inside the prison over two years (2017-2019). During his tenure, the artist noticed both correction officers and youth operating in a contagious trance-like state or completely asleep in what seemed like a stress-induced coma. Here, Rodriguez explores the surreal experience of sleeping under a shared toxic circumstance, in which these individuals, regardless of their different (and contrasting) roles, may cosmically engage with each other&mdash;perhaps in a common desire to escape the confines of the prison or more broadly the punitive system which defines American criminal justice.</p>

Park Avenue Departure,Alex Katz,2019-08-26,2019-11-10,Park Avenue Malls from 52nd Street to 59th Street,"<p>Lining the central reservation between 52nd and 59th Street, each of the seven works in this exhibition is an iteration of <em>Park Avenue Departure</em>, an eight-foot-tall cut-out depicting artist Alex Katz&rsquo;s wife, Ada, formed of porcelain enamel and steel. Katz began producing cut-outs in 1959. Depicting characters from New York&rsquo;s cultural coterie, the works move beyond representation, acting as vehicles for the artist&rsquo;s lifelong exploration into formal arrangement and the complexities of surface. The Park Avenue presentation adds a third dimension: the works shift in their composition according to the sightlines of the viewer. The repetition of the sculpture&mdash;which depicts the back of a figure such as an anonymous pedestrian would be seen from behind whilst walking the street&mdash;is akin to optical illusion, compelling viewers to double-take.</p><p>This exhibition is presented by the&nbsp;<a href=""https://fundforparkavenue.org/"">Fund for Park Avenue&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.kasmingallery.com/"">Paul Kasmin Gallery</a><u>.</u>&nbsp;</p>",M,40.762283,-73.970274,1
Under the Sun,Bill Soltis,2019-08-27,2020-07-31,Greenstreet on Flatbush Avenue between 7th Avenue and Park Place,"<p>Under the Sun is one of a series of sculptures by Brooklyn-based artist Bill Soltis about experimentation with the human form, positive and negative relationships and the interplay between the figure and a sculptural environment. The final piece is a marriage of these elements and the environment in which the sculpture rests. In his art, Soltis experiments with shapes, images, patterns, and lines, allowing the construction process to create the idea, rather than forcing a completely formed idea into becoming an object. As a subject, the human figure lends itself well to this open process. It can be left representational or made abstract. Its form can be smooth, angular, sharp, or curved, with active, passive, or emotive gestures. He often works with welded metal due to its versatility, permanence, and strength and ability to survive indoor, outdoors, in gardens, or urban settings equally well.</p>

However, Appriou&rsquo;s sculptures poetically reimagine the species. The artist carved clay and foam models to cast in aluminum, emphasizing the tool marks and fingerprints of his tactile process.

The Socrates Annual,Various Artists,2019-10-05,2020-03-08,,"<p>Each fall Socrates presents an exhibition of new commissions made by artists awarded the Park&rsquo;s Socrates Annual Fellowship. Produced on-site in our outdoor studio over the course of the summer, these artworks engage the Park&rsquo;s unique history, landscape, and surrounding community. For the 2019 exhibition, projects range from a soundscape conflating the sounds of animals and man-made objects to a monument to the invasive Ailanthus plant. Approaches vary among collaborative investigations of authorship and visibility, the re-contextualization of domestic motifs, and the examination of biological material, among many others. Ranging from fantastical to anecdotal to pedagogical, this year&rsquo;s artists use a variety of narrative strategies. Several artist projects examine storytelling&rsquo;s many material manifestations, from an homage to a Native American myth in which North America exists on a turtle&rsquo;s back to a suggestion that a giant has fallen asleep under the Park&rsquo;s blanket of grass, its exposed nose becoming refuge for a wandering monitor lizard.</p>

Monument,Krzysztof Wodiczko,2020-01-16,2020-05-10,,"?For Monument, Krzysztof Wodiczko collaborated with twelve refugees who have been resettled in the United States. Their filmed likenesses and spoken narratives are superimposed on the historic 1881 monument to Admiral David Glasgow Farragut, lauded in his day as a Union naval hero during the Civil War. Pertinent to this project is current scholarship documenting how the American Civil War drove millions &ndash; soldiers, civilians, stragglers, enslaved Africans, free people, Northerners and Southerners &ndash; from their homes to generate a nineteenth-century refugee crisis. Similarly, each filmed participant&rsquo;s home country has suffered the devastation of civil war which prompted Wodiczko to choose the Farragut location for this project to compare how select individuals are lionized in wartime and others are overlooked. With footage of people from Africa, Central America, South Asia, and the Middle East, the bronze monument emerges as a surrogate for refugees whose diverse plights, harrowing journeys, grueling fortitude, and quest for democracy have recently brought them to this country. Refugees are adults and children who flee their home countries because of war, persecution, and violence and who cross borders into the promised safety of another country.

Liberty Bell,Nancy Baker Cahill,2020-07-04,2021-07-03,Beach 108 St. at Rockaway Boardwalk and the Rockaway Ferry Landing,"<p>Liberty Bell is an animated, monumental, and richly sonorous augmented reality (AR) drawing in 360 degrees. The public artwork will be geolocated at a series of sites and experienced on smartphones and tablets through Baker Cahill&rsquo;s free 4th Wall app. This project, which is two years in the making, lives at the vibrant intersection of public art, social consciousness, and tech. It is being presented simultaneously in six cities in the United States: Boston, MA, Charleston, SC, Philadelphia, PA, Rockaway, NY, Selma, AL, and Washington, DC.</p>

<p>In this polarized and tumultuous election year, many concerns persist around the founding principles of American freedom and democracy. Inequality, structural racism, injustice, and the ability to vote are chief among them. Inspired by the original cracked Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, the drawing hovers beyond viewers, swaying with the rich and layered sound of bells tolling. The Liberty Bell soundscape morphs from the rhythmic lulling of a tolling bell, into a harmonious and dissonant sequence of ringing as it becomes increasingly unpredictable and arrhythmic. The richly textured brushstrokes and bell sounds resemble loosely knitted threads that unravel and come together in an uncomfortable, but cohesive moment. They reflect the evolution and transformation of liberty over time into the complex reality we face today. This exhibition is presented by Art Production Fund, in partnership with 7G Foundation and the Jamaica Bay-Rockaway Parks Conservancy, a project of the Fund for the City of New York.</p>",Q,40.579789,-73.828375,1

Freedman Plaza,"To mark the threshold between Central Park&rsquo;s boulder-filled terrain and Midtown Manhattan&rsquo;s built environment, Sam Moyer has created a massive three-part sculpture, with a title that pays homage to Public Art Fund founder, Doris C. Freedman (1928-1981). Moyer&rsquo;s hybrid sculpture unites imported stone with rock indigenous to the New York region. The artist inlaid marble fragments into three double-sided vertical concrete slabs and framed them with contrasting rough-hewn bluestone monoliths. Each stone in Moyer&rsquo;s mosaic compositions takes on an even more striking hue against the others and the locally-quarried rock, an apt metaphor that encourages us to consider the diverse character of our city and our interconnected lives within it. Their final arrangement demonstrates her impressive skill in composing sculptural forms, with its &ldquo;doors&rdquo; pivoted ajar to evoke the dynamism of the bustling city.&nbsp;</p>

The reality we find ourselves in is just a glimpse or sliver of an epic landscape of decisions that constantly eludes us. This work illustrates a bit of this conundrum by constructing a living model from a computer simulation in which multiple dimensions of decisions have been overlaid.

Medusa With The Head of Perseus,Luciano Garbati,2020-10-13,2021-08-31,,"<p>Medusa With The Head of Perseus is a seven-foot bronze sculpture that inverts the narrative of Medusa, portraying her in a moment of somberly empowered self-defense. In Ovid&rsquo;s Metamorphosis, Medusa was a maiden in the temple of Athena, who was stalked and raped by Poseidon. Athena, in a rage, banishes and curses Medusa with a monstrous head of snakes and a gaze which turns men to stone. Medusa is herself blamed and punished for the crime of which she was the victim; she is cast away as a monster and then with the cruel assistance of Athena and Poseidon, eventually is hunted-down and beheaded by the epic hero Perseus, who displays her head as a trophy on his shield. Garbati&rsquo;s sculpture speaks directly to the 16th Century Florentine bronze masterpiece Perseus with the Head of Medusa by Benvenuto Cellini (1545-1554). Through this work, Garbati asks &ldquo;how can a triumph be possible if you are defeating a victim?&rdquo;</p><p>This exhibition is presented by <a href=""https://www.mwthproject.com/"">MWTH Project</a>.</p>",M,40.716124,-74.001716,1

The scaffold, which prevents access physically and metaphorically, recalls a work site, an insistent image on the urban landscape. But the scaffold is golden, summoning the glory of labor and the luminosity in the struggle that can lead to change.&nbsp;&nbsp; The torch refers to the light of democracy and its foundation in ancient systems of government by citizens. In this project, DeVille conjoins significant crossroads in African-American history in New York to create a sculpture that is inspiring and introspective. She recognizes and hallows the earliest enslaved Africans who were brought to New Amsterdam, critiques the unfulfilled promise of American liberty and justice for all, and summons the current Black Lives Matter movement as a source for the work.</p>

The work is inspired by a rusted smokestack the artist saw at the locomotive workshop in Sekondi, Ghana that now has a tree growing from its mouth. For Mahama, the workshop is an important reference to the British use of railways to divide and exploit resources until the country regained its independence in 1959. While the British railways, a former industrial tank from North Carolina, and the High Line have very different industrial histories, Mahama notes that it&rsquo;s often when we zoom out, and remove ourselves from a specific space and time, that we can come to see our shared history all the better. The sculpture on the High Line also has a tree growing from its top, an important image for the artist that mirrors the torch of the Statue of Liberty to the south, and the non-human agents that continue to reinvent the conditions for living on this planet, even among the structures built and abandoned by humans.&nbsp;</p><p>This exhibition is presented by the <a href=""https://www.thehighline.org/art/projects/ibrahim-mahama/"">Friends of the High Line</a>.</p>",M,40.743498,-74.007037,1

Brighter Days,Melvin Edwards,2021-05-04,2021-11-28,,"<p>For over 50 years, Melvin Edwards has created public art for communities all around the world. His work reimagines monumental civic sculpture by uniting abstract forms with personal symbols to address issues of race, labor, and the African Diaspora. Brighter Days is a focused look at Edwards&rsquo; career through five sculptures from 1970 to 1996, and a sixth large-scale work commissioned in 2020. Each one incorporates some form of chain.</p>

<p>The context of City Hall Park adds resonance to the historical associations of these metal forms as tools of slavery and violence. This is the site of the African Burial Ground, a colonial-era cemetery for enslaved and freed individuals of African descent. More recently it became a geographic center of Black Lives Matter protests with the occupation of City Hall. Brighter Days, a title chosen by the artist, affirms his optimistic view of our shared future. Tracing the long arc of Edwards&rsquo; career, these six sculptures encourage us to remain mindful of the past as we cherish the social linkages that are more important than ever.</p>

This past year has been difficult for many of our students as they navigated the restrictions caused by the pandemic and the absence of critical social interactions. The objective of our annual gallery show is to celebrate young artists of color and give them a platform to be seen and heard. This exhibit builds tremendous confidence and pride in our students and allows them to build their communication skills as they engage with the public and articulate their thoughts on their work.,M,40.746723,-74.004524,1
