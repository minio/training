If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. Let your imagination be your guide. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us.

Nothing wrong with washing your brush. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. I like to beat the brush.

Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. Let all these things just sort of happen. Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. Isn't that fantastic that you can make whole mountains in minutes?

That's crazy. Here we're limited by the time we have. Now it's beginning to make a little sense.

It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. We need dark in order to show light. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate.
