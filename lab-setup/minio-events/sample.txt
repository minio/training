You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy.

The least little bit can do so much. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants. By now you should be quite happy about what's happening here. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. There we are.
