Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen.

That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. Little short strokes. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. This is truly an almighty mountain.

We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want.

Mountains are so simple, they're hard. Have fun with it. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them.

You can do it. Don't be bashful drop me a line. We need dark in order to show light. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first.
