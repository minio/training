In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us.

Let's get crazy. You can do it. Have fun with it. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there.

You can create anything that makes you happy. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. It is a lot of fun.

La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Working it up and down, back and forth.

You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. Let's have a nice tree right here. Everybody needs a friend.
