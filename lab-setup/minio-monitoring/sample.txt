In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. You gotta think like a tree. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. You need to have a very firm paint to do this.

You can do it. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us.

Isn't that fantastic? You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. Maybe, just to play a little, we'll put a little tree here. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good.

I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. We don't have anything but happy trees here.

Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. Anyone can paint. Let's get wild today. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. Those great big fluffy clouds.
