Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here.

We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbersâ€”just to upset the critics. It is a lot of fun. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here.

Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen.

Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. It's cold, but it's beautiful.

This is gonna be a happy little seascape. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington.
